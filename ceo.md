# Values

My [Kouzes Posner
Values](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/name-your-top-5-leadership-core-values-cant-do-heres-how-marcie-white/)
are Family, Health, Trust, Communication, Autonomy.

That last one is important.  I expect to act within my values, I expect to be
trusted, I expect to have open lines of communication and I expect you will want
similar.  I recognize you may not have the same values as I do, but I will start
from that assumption.

My autonomy value (and assumption that you share such) means I have historically
had trouble telling people what to do.  I do much better to align on where we’re
going and trust your autonomy and decision making to get us there.  I will
respect your time and expect you to respect mine.  Getting home to family and
making space for my own health and wellbeing are crucial and I will assume you
want similar.

## On management
* I think of myself as being in a support role.
* I’ve been told “you can’t always be in the room” so you have to get people to
  make the right decisions without you there.  I’ve come to believe “you’re
  never in the room”, so the only thing you can control is incentives. Crafting
  incentives is I believe the primary job of the CEO.

## Managing me
* I work out of my inbox, so short emails are best (rather than chats or doc
  comments) if you need something from me.  Chat is fine if it’s urgent.
* My calendly is widely shared and open for others to use to get on my schedule.

## On meetings
* We're a small company, so we shouldn't have many/any internal meetings yet.
* Meetings should have an agenda.
* I prepare for my 1:1s.  I keep 1:1 docs with anyone who has a regular 1:1.  I
  take notes in that doc between meetings.

## Quotes and platitudes I agree with
* Begin with the end in mind (Stephen Covey, 7 Habits)
* Focus on the user and all else will follow (a Shorebird value)
* The doer decides (e.g. autonomy value)
* Paul Graham: “Meetings are a necessary evil.  Sometimes necessary, but still
  evil.”
* Problems of success -- e.g. some classes of problems only happen when you
  succeed, so let's deal with them after we’re on a path to succeed.
