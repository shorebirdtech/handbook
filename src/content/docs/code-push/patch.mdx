import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Once you have published a release of your app, you can push updates using one
of the `shorebird patch` commands.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="patch-command-android" label="Android">

```
shorebird patch android
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="patch-command-ios" label="iOS">

```
shorebird patch ios
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will do several things:

1. Builds the artifacts for the update.
1. Downloads the corresponding release artifacts.
1. Generates a patch using the diff between the release and the current changes.
1. Uploads the patch artifacts to the Shorebird backend
1. Promotes the patch to the stable channel.

By default, this uses the release version that the app is currently on. If you
want to patch a different release version, you can use the `--release-version`
option. For example:

```
shorebird patch android --release-version 0.1.0+1
```

If your application supports flavors or multiple release targets, you can specify the flavor and target using the `--flavor` and `--target` options:

```
shorebird patch [android|ios] --target lib/main_development.dart --flavor development
```

:::info
`shorebird patch` wraps `flutter build` and can take any argument
`flutter build` can. To pass arguments to the underlying `flutter build` you
need to put `flutter build` arguments after a `--` separator. For example:
`shorebird patch android -- --dart-define="foo=bar"` will define the `"foo"` environment
variable inside Dart as you might have done with `flutter build` directly.
