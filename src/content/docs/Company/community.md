The Flutter Community is something that we deeply value and aim to help build and grow. We do this by not just building products but also being active members in the worldwide community via online and in person mediums.

## Shorebird Discord

Shorebird uses Discord for (almost) all public & private communications. You can join it at https://discord.gg/shorebird.

On the Shorebird Discord we group channels:

- Public (Publicly read/writeable)
- Customers (Private between us and individual customers)
- Partners (Private between us and companies we partner with)
- External (Publicly readable, Shorebird writeable)
- Internal (Shorebird private)

We intentionally co-locate our private communications in the same app as our
public customers use. This makes it easy to chat with our customers directly
every day, and helps us make sure we're fixing things they care about.

There are trade-offs with this approach.

One tradeoff is it makes it easier to accidentally post something private in a
public space. One of the ways we try to avoid this is by defaulting to public.
With few exceptions, we try to do everything in the public, thus reducing risks
of things "accidentally" being public.

Another potential downside is that as we've grown the chatter and support
burden can be difficult. You should feel empowered to mute as much of Discord
as you need to do get your job done.

### Discord Bots

One key feature of Discord that we take advantage of are bots. They allow for some key functionality to ensure we can run a good online space for everyone involved.

- Translator - With customers all over the world we can't rely on everyone being able to, or being comfortable with, speaking English. In order to help this we have a Translator Bot which is in all of our channels to allow for easily translation from any language to English and back as needed. There are also specific language channels in an "Auto-Translate" section which are setup for places where we see a concentration of customers.
- Mentions - This is actually two bots which both post to the #mentions channel. They troll Twitter/X and BlueSky for mentions of Shorebird so we can keep up with whats going on in the community.
- AutoMod - This is just a built in part of Discord which we have configured. It can auto flag messages that trip its spam, flagged words, etc lists and will post them to a private channel for our admins to determine if it should be posted.
