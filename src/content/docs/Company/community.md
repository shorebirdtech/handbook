The Flutter Community is something that we deeply value and aim to help build
and grow. We do this by not just building products but also being active members
in the worldwide community via online and in person mediums.

## Discord

We use Discord for (almost) all public & private communications. You can join it
at https://discord.gg/shorebird.

On the Discord Server we group channels:

- Public (Publicly read/writeable)
- Customers (Private between us and individual customers)
- Partners (Private between us and companies we partner with)
- External (Publicly readable, Employee writeable)
- Internal (Employee only)

We intentionally co-locate our private communications in the same app as our
public customers use. This makes it easy to chat with our customers directly
every day, and helps us make sure we're fixing things they care about.

There are trade-offs with this approach.

One tradeoff is it makes it easier to accidentally post something private in a
public space. One of the ways we try to avoid this is by defaulting to public.
With few exceptions, we try to do everything in the public, thus reducing risks
of things "accidentally" being public.

Another potential downside is that as we've grown the chatter and support burden
can be difficult. You should feel empowered to mute as much of Discord as you
need to do get your job done.

### Discord Bots

One key feature of Discord that we take advantage of are bots. They allow for
some key functionality to ensure we can run a good online space for everyone
involved.

- Translator - With customers all over the world we can't rely on everyone being
  able to, or being comfortable with, speaking English. In order to help this we
  have a Translator Bot which is in all of our channels to allow for easily
  translation from any language to English and back as needed. There are also
  specific language channels in an "Auto-Translate" section which are setup for
  places where we see a concentration of customers.
- Mentions - This utilizes [Octolens](https://octolens.com) to search for
  mentions of us as a company/product out on the web and alert us to when we are
  part of the conversation.
- AutoMod - This is just a built in part of Discord which we have configured. It
  can auto flag messages that trip its spam, flagged words, etc lists and will
  post them to a private channel for our admins to determine if it should be
  posted.
