This document ensures a secure and consistent process when an employee exits the
company, including revocation of access, return of company assets, and knowledge
transfer. This is really the implementation details of the
[Offboarding and Access Termination section of our Human Resource Security Policy](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/compliance/hr-security-policy/#offboarding-and-access-termination).

Please note that this is a checklist and that not all items will apply to all
employees. Managers should work with employees throughout this process to
ensure all required items are completed.

## Exit Event

**This starts when an employee has given notice or is terminated.**

- Confirm resignation or termination in writing.
- Determine last working day and communicate to relevant internal teams.
- Schedule off boarding meetings with relevant people. As a starting point
  please consider the following:
  - Your Manager
  - People Operations
- Plan knowledge transfer sessions and identify documentation needs.
- Set final day for employment in Rippling.

## Company Property Recovery

**Timeline for this to be created after an exit event. May be completed after
final day given shipping times.**

- Retrieve or confirm destruction of:
  - Company-issued laptops, phones, or hardware tokens
  - Physical access cards or security badges
- Update the asset inventory log.
- Disable remote wipe options once device is returned.

## Communication & Knowledge Transfer

**Manager and Employee should begin working on a plan for these items after an
exit event.**

- Announce departure internally with clarity and respect.
- Set up out-of-office reply or forward emails as appropriate.
- Notify customers or partners (if employee held external role).
- Document outstanding work, current blockers, and context. Determine best place
  to document (Code Comments, PR's, Issues, Docs) based on the context needed.
- Conduct project handoff meetings.
- Ensure technical documentation is up to date.

## Final People Operations and Legal Tasks

**To be completed on or before last working day.**

- Prepare final paycheck (Rippling will do this automatically for US employees).
- Terminate benefits and provide COBRA notice (if applicable), automatic in Rippling for US employees.
- Disable access to Rippling (automatic, but listed in case of non-rippling employees).
- Conduct exit interview (document feedback and insights)

## Access and Security

**To be completed on or before last working day.**

- Revoke access to:
  - Google Workspace (automatic in rippling)
  - Google Cloud
  - GitHub
    - Remove from Organization
    - Remove from Codeowners files
  - Discord (remove Birder role)
- Transfer ownership of:
  - Google Drive contents

## Post-Exit Verification
