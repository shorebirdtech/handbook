These guidelines will evolve over time. As written they are heavily influenced
by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

# Introduction

Benefits are currently written US-centric as all Shorebird employees currently
reside in the US. We may adapt offered benefits in country/region specific
manners as we learn to employ persons there.

## Compensation and Equity

Shorebird has so far only hired for "Founding" roles where we recognize that
you're taking on a significant set of risk and responsibility. Our compensation
for Founding roles have targeted >90th percentile equity and 70th percentile
cash compensation. We have used a variety of benchmarking services (pave.com,
levels.fyi) to help us match market rates. We expect this balance will
necessarily shift as we grow as a company.

In alignment with our remote-only approach, we have thus far chosen to adjust
pay based only on country rather than city level location. The belief being that
different countries have different "social contracts" for who pays for what, but
that the work we are doing is the same regardless of where one might chose to
live within a country.

## Paid Time Off

Shorebird has a flexible PTO policy up to 10 contiguous days without asking and
we encourage everyone to step away from the keyboard for at least 10 days per
calendar year. We care about impact on the company and our users, not your time
at keyboard; taking time for ourselves is an important part of ensuring our time
working can be productive.

We currently observe 11 public holidays matching the US federal holiday
calendar. The official list is kept in Rippling.

## All Remote

Shorebird is an all-remote company. We do not have an office. We aspire to
eventually hire all over the globe. Currently all employees are based in the US
and within GMT-5 to GMT-8.

## Health Insurance

Shorebird offers competitive healthcare plans for all US employees and
dependents, including dental and vision. For 2026, we are covering 95% of
premiums for employees and 50% of premiums for dependents. Our current provider
is Blue Cross Blue Shield, brokered through Rippling.com.

## 401k

Shorebird provides a 401k plan for all US employees with 4% employer match. Our
current provider is Accrue, brokered through Rippling.com.

## Parental Leave

Shorebird provisions for Parental Leave which may apply to team members but this
may vary depending on local country laws. Currently this section is written
US-centric as all Shorebird employees currently reside in the US.

Shorebird provides 16 weeks of paid parental leave for any active team member
(regardless of gender) who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption while
working at Shorebird. The entire 16 week balance must be used within 12 months
of the birth or adoption.

As we've not yet had a team member take parental leave, so I'm sure there are
more details to cover when we get there.

## Life Insurance

We provide automatic 50k life insurance for all employees, with supplemental
insurance available through our provider, Beam.

## Short-term / Long-term Disability

We are unable to offer short or long term disability insurance at this time.
We've been told we must exist as a company for 2 years before we can offer
disability insurance. We'll update this section when we have more information.

### Medical Leave

For Code Town Inc. employees requiring time off for serious health conditions,
surgeries, or hospitalization, we provide 100% salary continuation for up to 4
weeks

Full-time employees with at least 90 days of tenure are eligible, following a
medical condition requiring an absence of more than 3 consecutive days.

Minor Illness, e.g. Short-term sickness (colds, flu) is covered under our
standard PTO. Childbirth and bonding are covered exclusively under our Parental
Leave Policy (16 weeks). Benefits cannot be stacked.

Code Town Inc. provides up to 4 weeks of 100% salary continuation per rolling
12-month period.

If you reside in a state with mandated disability or paid medical leave (e.g.,
CA, NY, WA), you must apply for those benefits. Code Town Inc. will "top up"
state payments to match 100% of your regular salary. Leave management is all
handled through Rippling and our leave provider, Tilt.

Requests for leave extending beyond 4 weeks are considered on a case-by-case
basis. Extensions are at the sole discretion of management, based on business
needs and individual circumstances. Granting an extension in one instance does
not create an entitlement for future requests.

Your position (or an equivalent) is protected during the 4-week salary
continuation period and any approved extensions, or as otherwise required by
applicable state law.

To use this policy, notify your manager as soon as practicable. For foreseeable
leaves (e.g., surgery), please provide at least 30 days' notice. We reserve the
right to request medical certification of the necessity and duration of the
leave.
