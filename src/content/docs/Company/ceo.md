## Values

My
[Kouzes Posner Values](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/name-your-top-5-leadership-core-values-cant-do-heres-how-marcie-white/)
are Family, Health, Trust, Communication, Autonomy.

I expect to act within my values, I expect to be trusted, I expect to have open
lines of communication and I expect you will want similar. I recognize you may
not have the same values as I do, but I will start from that assumption.

My autonomy value (and assumption that you share such) means I have historically
had trouble telling people what to do. I do much better to align on where we’re
going and trust your autonomy and decision making to get us there. I will
respect your time and expect you to respect mine. Getting home to family and
making space for my own health and wellbeing are crucial and I will assume you
want similar.

## On management

- I think of myself as being in a support role.
- I’ve been told “you can’t always be in the room” so you have to get people to
  make the right decisions without you there. I’ve come to believe “you’re never
  in the room”, so the only thing you can control is incentives. Crafting
  incentives is I believe the primary job of a leader.

## Managing me

- I work out of my inbox, so short emails are best (rather than chats or doc
  comments) if you need something from me as once it's in my inbox it's on my
  todo list and will (eventually) get done. Chat is fine if it’s urgent.
- [My calendly](https://calendly.com/eseidel) is widely shared and open for
  others to use to get on my schedule. Those at Shorebird have direct access
  (and currently full visibility of) my calendar.

## On meetings

- We're a small company, so we shouldn't have many/any internal meetings yet.
- Meetings should have an agenda.
- I prepare for my 1:1s. I keep 1:1 docs with anyone who has a regular 1:1. I
  take notes in that doc between meetings.

## Quotes and platitudes I agree with

- Begin with the end in mind (Stephen Covey, 7 Habits)
- Focus on the user and all else will follow
- The doer decides (e.g. responsibility deserves autonomy)
- Paul Graham: “Meetings are a necessary evil. Sometimes necessary, but still
  evil.”
- Problems of success -- e.g. some classes of problems only happen when you
  succeed, so let's deal with them after we’re on a path to succeed.
