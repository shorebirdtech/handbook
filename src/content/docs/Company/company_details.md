Code Town, Inc (d.b.a Shorebird) is a Delaware C Corp, founded to foster
adoption of multi-platform development globally. We were founded by some of the
same team who built Flutter and Dart and use those as our vehicle.

Shorebird is the name of the street on which Flutter was created and a nod to
the beginnings of the technology we enjoy to build upon.

## Purpose

Portable development is not the default. Most businesses spend twice, or three
times what they need to to reach all their users. Google’s open source UI
toolkit, Flutter has answered some of this need and made it possible to deliver
high quality UIs to multiple screens at once. Other offerings, e.g. React
Native, Cordova, Xamarin have also tried to solve part of this problem.

Today, developers receive an incomplete offering, one “thrown over the wall” by
Google. Today, Flutter is constrained by Google’s development model and internal
politics. JSON is the most popular way to talk over the network, yet Google’s
Flutter offering has terrible support, since Google itself doesn’t use JSON
internally. Flutter developers often fight terribly long build times, because
Google itself uses a different source control, and different build system
internally. Flutter apps by-default look Google-branded, because Flutter is
tightly coupled to Google’s design language.

One of the most common questions asked about Flutter, is when will Google kill
it? Google has a reputation for killing products (e.g.
[https://killedbygoogle.com/](https://killedbygoogle.com/)). If Google stopped
Flutter tomorrow, there would be a mad scramble to pick up the pieces because
many businesses and developers depend on it. This uncertainty need not be so. A
foundation can, and should, be built around Flutter and its stakeholders more
distributed. But a foundation is not enough. Foundations move slowly, often
suffer from tight-budgets, administrative overhead, and design-by-committee. A
company is also needed to set a direction, directly aligned with public
customers rather than Google-internal ones, and deliver a golden path and value
to users.

Someone needs to stand up for portable development. Build amazing, complete
solutions for developers and businesses of all sizes with the goal to make high
quality, portable development, the default. That someone is Shorebird.

## Our Story

Incentives matter. At sufficient scale, the team and community make decisions
based on the incentives they operate under rather than direction from one
person. Today, Flutter’s incentives are aligned around Google, not the wide
world of developers who use Flutter.

Shorebird is about aligning incentives with those we serve in ways existing
consultancies cannot, big Flutter users cannot, and Google cannot. High quality
portable software is inevitable. But BigTech, little consultancies, and open
source alone will not make it the default. The largest problems facing flutter,
and high quality portable software writ-large, are ones that cannot be solved
within any Big Tech, or large users of Flutter, but have to be done by a new
upstart who is commercializing Flutter.

We’re doing this now, because Flutter is big enough. Most of the foundational
technical problems are solved (language performance and tooling, graphics
performance, ecosystem bootstrapping etc.) and what’s missing now is the
critical relationships and commercial alignment with the interests of the common
Flutter user. We are starting this journey by filling the gaps that we can best
fill. That doesn’t mean we fill all the gaps ourselves. We become synonymous
with Flutter by democratic means, because we’re the best and most aligned with
developers, not by fiat.

## Mission

Our mission is to make high-quality, portable software the default way to build
for everyone.

We are most successful when we build things that only we can build. There are
many things big tech cannot build due to incentives, and other companies cannot
build due to know how. Our first product was Code Push, one of the most
requested features in Flutter. We then built CI for Flutter, something many have
built before, but most have built more generically than just Flutter. We are
unique in that we sell only to Flutter developers and thus can build things
specifically fit to their purposes. Over time our product suite will grow to be
both specific to Flutter and highly integrated within itself. Our value to
developers is productivity, completeness, quality and alignment with their
needs.

We serve developers by making them more productive. When they use Shorebird,
they don’t have to build or integrate as much themselves, they get further,
faster. They can follow our golden path and use our managed solutions for their
creation, sharing, testing, and deployment.

We serve businesses by making their developers more productive and providing
them security and assurance to their investments. When they use Shorebird, they
know they’re using something they can rely on and they can call when they need.
They know that they’re buying best-in-class solutions. They know they’re buying
from a business that will be here tomorrow, not just an open source project that
may not be maintained. They know that their developers are more productive, and
happier when using our solutions.

## Vision

We believe in a world where building software once means it works everywhere,
beautifully.

If we succeed, the majority of development is portable with high-quality
outcomes. Today in the gaming world, developers reach for portable solutions
first. This is both because those solutions produce the best outcomes the
fastest and they let developers figure out the fun stuff first and the platforms
later. In the future, app developers will also reach for Shorebird first,
because we serve them and their interests, not the platform vendors. Shorebird
will help them produce the best quality products, and know that they can take
them to any device or any screen they need to, without needless rewrites.

In this future the Flutter ecosystem is rich and robust, not just Shorebird.
There is a Flutter foundation, which Shorebird is a large part of. Flutter and
Dart are successful across all the devices businesses care to reach, including
desktop, web and servers. Shorebird is synonymous with Flutter, just like
Confluent with Kafka, or Apollo with GraphQL today. Businesses confidently reach
for portable software development from Shorebird first, knowing it’s the safe
and supported choice.

In the future, the world around us has also shifted. We’re far from alone in
this journey. There will be more platforms, there will be more OS vendors. The
web will change in part through the popularity of an alternative portability
solution. There is likely a Flutter browser or at least Flutter and the web have
grown closer as two communities with similar goals. Flutter itself will no
longer be a just-for-Google solution.

## Values

### Principles

- Developer productivity matters. Developers are the reason we exist, their
  success is our goal and we will always put them first.
- Our best work is open by default. We believe in transparency and openness. We
  live in a big world. Shorebird (and Flutter) serve a global audience. We can't
  always be in the room and so the best way to "set others up to succeed" is to
  write things down in the open. Open Source is what made Flutter successful
  (and web browsers before it) and will be what makes Shorebird successful.
- Real artists ship. It's more important to ship, be wrong and learn than to
  ship right the first time.
- The future is bigger than the past. It's more important to make a better
  tomorrow than worry about our present or past. At time of writing, there are
  only a few million Flutter developers. There are billions of people, and
  probably 100s of millions of developers in the future. We're here to help them
  all.

### What makes us distinctly Shorebird

- Our developer empathy: Developers are our customers, we must empathize with
  them, talk to them, and solve problems for them.
- Our belief in high-quality, portable software: Many today accept what the
  platform vendors offer, we don’t. We know software development can be better,
  and that developers shouldn’t repeat themselves, businesses shouldn’t spend
  2x/3x what they need to, and customers shouldn’t suffer from divergent,
  half-as-good experiences with 2x the bugs. We believe better is possible, the
  world deserves it, and we can make it happen.
- Our open-ness: we are private when we need to be (e.g. to protect customers,
  to protect employees or to protect trade secrets over the short term), but by
  default and over the long term, we are public when we can be to reach the
  widest audience and keep ourselves to good practices of behavior and
  integrity.

## Culture

I feel proud to work here, because I believe I’m making developer’s lives
better. Flutter has made developer’s lives better, but the next steps for
Flutter couldn’t be taken inside Google. We can, and we will, and that will help
more people produce awesome products and go home earlier to spend more time with
their families, instead of writing a translation of their previous work into
Kotlin, and then again in Swift, and again in TypeScript or Go or whatever.

Shorebird is a great place for self-starters, who know how to self-manage, and
enjoy the freedom of remote work. People who like working with strong colleagues
regardless of their physical location and are excited to solve problems for
developers and businesses. Birders have a sense of quality, they care about
their own work product and the tools they’re providing to others. We’re proud to
empower our customers to do their best work. We’re proud to be a part of a
larger community. We feel good at the end of the week that we’ve made the world
a little better by empowering developers who in turn touch billions of lives
every week.

Users of Shorebird should feel that they’ve picked products designed for their
use cases and outcomes. That Shorebird is accessible to them in the way any good
open source project would, and _responds_ to their needs in the way a commercial
product does. Users should feel safe, knowing that they’ve picked a solution
that’s reliable and sustainable, that supports them throughout the lifetime of
their product and they will get promoted for using, not wrist-slapped by their
boss. Users also know that by betting on Flutter and Shorebird they’ve found
themselves a career, because they know they can take their skills to any screen
and any product, not just be limited to a specific mobile framework.

The emotional core of our work is empowerment. We serve developers. They will
feel like they could build what we’ve built themselves, but they will choose to
use our solutions because they are hiring us for a “job to be done.” We are not
the end product they sell to their customers, and they will feel that having
hired us they will get further, faster with better outcomes for themselves,
their business and their users.

### A note on remote-only

Eric worked mostly on web browsers before starting Flutter -- something used
globally by billions of people and built open source by persons from every
corner of the globe. It taught him that there are truly brilliant and motivated
people everywhere. Leading Flutter and Dart (including through pandemic
lockdowns and the resulting work-from-home diaspora) showed him that
remote-first can work and that people can do their best work when you don't care
where they live but rather what they get done. So that's what we're doing at
Shorebird. Hiring the best people, wherever they are.

Remote also has its downsides, clearly. Culture is much harder. How do you build
social experiences at work for those who want it? How do you build a unified
understanding of what the company is (as things inevitably change) without being
in the same room regularly? GitLab and others have written extensively on these
[challenges](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/). So we
don't know, but we sure as heck are gonna try. The world is simply too big and
too filled with talented people to limit our hiring to one location.

So far our (very early) learnings have reinforced our believe in remote-only,
but made us question if async-only remote will work. We're still learning.

  Flutter before Shorebird. Was previously Director of Flutter and Dart at
  Google. Eric has been working on helping the world stop writing everything
  twice 20 years, including major contributions to WebKit, Safari, Blink and
  Chrome.

- Bryan Oltman ([@bryanoltman](https://x.com/bryanoltman)), Founding Engineer --
  Was previously Tech Lead on Google's internal Flutter team and has extensive
  experience with enterprise usage of Flutter.

- Tom Arra ([@tom_arra](https://x.com/tom_arra)), Operations Lead -- Tom has
  been a member of the Flutter community since 2018 and has helped scale
  products and teams at companies like BMW and Very Good Ventures before joining
  Shorebird. He has over 15 years of experience in the software industry
  including being an engineering lead, and leading large teams in the product
  and engineering space.

- Dawn Parzych ([@dparzych](https://x.com/dparzych)), Marketing Lead -- Dawn is
  a developer-focused marketing leader with expertise in developer tools and
  cloud. She has led major events and marketing initiatives at Cloudflare and
  LaunchDarkly, and has served as a volunteer organizer for DevOpsDays.

  a product-oriented approach and experience building user-facing dashboards at
  scale. Excited to help developers focus on building better apps instead of
  building them twice.

## Management

We don't currently have managers, or plan to anytime soon. Everyone just reports
to Eric. This will eventually break down at scale. While leading Flutter, Eric
had 20+ direct reports before we added more managers. Managers are very useful
for supporting people (checking in regularly, helping with onboarding, career
development, etc), but can get in the way of constant direct coordination needed
in small teams.

## Communication

Right now we all just use Discord. We have email, but mostly we use that for
communicating to the outside world or things which need a more permanent record.
Everything else happens on Discord, and 90%+ in public channels.

Flutter started with daily stand-ups (capped to 5 minutes total) and kept those
all the way until 30-40 people. It was a chance to promote daily coordination
between members of the team and as we got larger (10+) help make sure
individuals had resources to be unblocked and didn't accidentally work on the
same issues. I imagine we'll find something similar for Shorebird (synchronous

<!--- cspell:disable-next-line -->

or not) and may even do them publicly. We'll see. For now we use the #standup
channel on Discord to post what we're working on each day.

## Spending company money

We don't have much process around this yet. In short, we trust you to make the
right decisions for the company. I think GitLab has a
[very sane policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) on
this and we'll likely adopt something similar.

## Future Products / User Pain

I've spoken with many Flutter customers. They love Flutter, but still find pain
using or adopting it within their businesses. Some of the top pains I've heard
from existing Flutter enterprise teams are:

- Mobile releasing is hard. Mobile releasing is harder than web. Maintaining
  lots of versions of apps (and associated backends) is hard. "Code Push" is one
  solution, but Google's Flutter team has chosen not to invest in it. We should.
- Keeping product and other stakeholders abreast of latest changes is hard. Some
  would like something akin to Vercel's "Deploy Previews" for Flutter apps.
- Teams share mobile code, would like to share backend code. Most shops write in
  Flutter for mobile and then a variety of languages for backends. Many have
  backends they would not fully re-write, so would need to plug in with existing
  other services.
- Teams share mobile code, would like to share web code. Most shops write in
  Flutter for mobile and then React for the web.
- Dart/Flutter builds are too long. Most often this doesn't seem to be Dart or
  Flutter itself, but rather the mobile build systems, particularly when plugins
  are involved.
- Hard to manage many apps. Coordinating updates (e.g. a logo) across multiple
  apps and multiple releases is hard, even with Flutter.
- Crash reporting and analytics are "meh". Existing solutions are not great for
  Flutter. Some complaints that Sentry doesn't play nicely with lots of versions
  in the wild (assumes a model of servers or web with one or few live versions).
  Other complaints that existing analytics solutions don't fully understand
  Flutter views (where the user has scrolled to, etc.).
- Knowing what to use in the Flutter ecosystem is hard. Quality of the Flutter
  ecosystem is inconsistent. Platform availability within the Flutter ecosystem
  is inconsistent.
- Testing Flutter apps (and mobile apps in general) is hard. Some have asked for
  something like [Mobile.dev](https://mobile.dev/) for Flutter apps. Particular
  trouble around testing "invasive" apps, such as ones which use system
  accessibility events.
