## Spending Company Money

We will pay for the items you need to get your job done. We will provide you
equipment when you start and you will also be provided a company card through
which to order things needed to advance the company.

In most cases, your time is by far the companies largest expense. For a sense of
scale: engineers in the US cost ~1k per workday, so if you're spending <1k to
advance the company more than a day forward, that's likely the right call.

### Spending Guidelines

1. Spend company money like it is your own money. No, really. We hired you
   because we believe you make good decisions. That includes with money.
2. You don't have to ask permission before making purchases in the interest of
   the company. If you're in doubt, just ping Eric.
3. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office
   supplies yourself and expense them.
4. You may privately use Shorebird property, a laptop for example, to check your
   private e-mails or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm
   Shorebird, or interfere with Intellectual Property.
5. If you make a purchase that will cost Shorebird $1000 USD per item (or over),
   unless otherwise stated, this is classified as company property, you will be
   required to return the item(s) if you leave the company.

Any non-company expenses should not be paid with a company credit card, but
sometimes mistakes happen. We use Ramp and it has tools to help you reimburse
the company for accidental personal expenses.

In my (Eric's) experience, expense value outcomes tend to be binary. Things that
I use every day end up costing effectively nothing, things that I don't use end
up costing effectively infinity. I've found the same to be true at Shorebird.
Spend money on things we are using to provide value to our customers and we'll
be very happy we spent it.

### Home Office

Most Shorebird employees work from their homes. We want you to be comfortable
and productive in your chosen work environment. We will provide you with a
laptop and a company card to purchase any additional equipment you need.

Spending guidelines:

- New hires are encouraged to expense up to 1,500 USD (or equivalent local
  currency) as part of setting up your home office.
- Existing team is encouraged to spend up to 500 USD (or equivalent local
  currency) to purchase upgrades, replacements, or enhancements to your home
  office setup.

Example items include chair, desk, monitor, headset, external mic, external
keyboard and external mouse, additional monitors, laptop stand, external webcam,
supplementary lighting, laptop bag/case. Home office equipment is not considered
company property and you are not required to return it if you leave the company.
Laptops and devices are company property and must be returned if you leave the
company.

These amounts were set based on
[GitLab's policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#equipment).
As above, you should be spending company money when you believe it is advancing
the company. You being comfortable and productive in your chosen work
environment is a big part of that.

Depending on your local laws, you may also be able to claim tax benefits for use
of your home office, please consult with a tax professional.

#### Home Office Internet

As part of supporting home office use, Shorebird will pay for the cost of your
internet connection up to $100 USD per month. This is based on
[GitLab's policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#internet).

### Co-working Spaces

We recognize that not all team members will have space at home to work, in that
case we will provide a budget for co-working spaces. Our current budget is $700
USD (or equivalent local currency) per month. This is based on
[GitLab's policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#co-working-space).

## Travel

We try to gather for a week, 2-4 times a year as a whole company. For such
gatherings, of course, Shorebird covers all travel expenses. So far we've
traveled to Chicago, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Phoenix and Austin.

### Tips for booking travel

- Use your company card for all travel expenses when possible.
- Rental cars are rarely worth it. Uber/Lyft is usually cheaper/better (even for
  1+ hour rides).
- Book hotels and flights _directly_ with the hotel/airline. It's usually
  cheaper and you get better service. The various booking sites are sometimes
  cheaper but non-refundable. (Most are effectively SEO/marketing companies that
  take a majority cut of the booking and result in the hotel/airline not being
  able to adjust your reservation or refund you since they themselves only got a
  small cut of the booking.)
- Book refundable flights. It's usually only $100 more for US travel and allows
  us to adjust plans without losing the entire ticket cost.
- Airbnb can often get a nice place for cheaper than individual hotel rooms if
  you're interested in sharing a house with others.
