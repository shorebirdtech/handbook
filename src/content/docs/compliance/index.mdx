This section documents our compliance polices and procedures for Code Town, Inc.
overall. This exists both for education of our employees as well as for
reference by our customers as needed. Authorship and change history for these
documents are visible in the git history of this
[repository](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook).

Management reviews these documents annually. Changes or exceptions to these
policies should be reviewed by the CEO.

These policies have been created and put in practice as part of our ISO 27001
Certification process. This currently has an expected completion timeline of
Q2 2026.

If you have questions about the practices in place for our products, those
details can be found on our
[docs site](https://docs.shorebird.dev/system/security/).
