## Purpose and Scope

This Human Resource Security Policy establishes guidelines and procedures for
safeguarding Code Town's information assets through effective human resource
management practices.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who have
access to Code Town's systems and data.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

This policy outlines our commitments to implementing and maintaining a
comprehensive human resource security program that aligns with industry best
practices and regulatory requirements.

### Recruitment and Onboarding

Appropriate reference checks on all prospective employees, contractors, and
third parties who will have access to Code Town’s data or systems are conducted.

Information security roles and responsibilities are clearly defined,
communicated, and maintained for all employees and contractors.

All new personnel are required to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality
agreements before accessing company data or systems.

### During Employment

All employees and contractors must participate in mandatory security awareness
and training programs to promote a strong security culture within Code Town.

Performance management includes security practices reviews, such as recognition
of good security behavior and prompt and fair addressing of security mistakes or
violations.

A disciplinary process for addressing security violations is established and
maintained.

### Offboarding and Access Termination

When employment or contractual relationships end, all access to Code Town’s
systems, data, and physical assets must be revoked promptly, and company
property returned.

Departing employees are reminded of their ongoing obligation not to share
company information. Confidentiality obligations are extended beyond the
termination of employment.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.

In case of non-compliance, the following high-level process is followed:

1. Workforce members report non-compliance of Code Town's policies and
   procedures to the Security Officer or other individual as assigned by the
   Security Officer. Individuals that report violations in good faith may not be
   subjected to intimidation, threats, coercion, discrimination against, or any
   other retaliatory action as a consequence.
2. The Security Officer promptly facilitates a thorough investigation of all
   reported violations of Code Town's security policies and procedures. The
   Security Officer may request the assistance from others.
3. Any individual found to be in violation of Code Town policies may be
   subjected to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. Violation
   of this policy and procedures by others, including customers, and partners
   may result in termination of the relationship and/or associated privileges.
4. The Security Officer facilitates taking appropriate steps to prevent
   recurrence of the violation (when possible and feasible).
5. The Security Officer maintains all documentation of the investigation,
   sanctions provided, and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence for a minimum
   of seven years after the conclusion of the investigation.
