## Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes guidelines for identifying, assessing, and managing
information security risks at Code Town.

This policy outlines our approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks
related to information security.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements outline our approach to risk management,
covering all aspects from risk identification to treatment and monitoring.

### Risk Tolerance

Risk Tolerance defines the acceptable variation in performance relative to the
company’s risk appetite. Code Town sets thresholds based on the severity of risk
impact:

- **High residual risks** (e.g., regulatory non-compliance, major financial
  loss): These risks are treated with the highest priority, with immediate
  corrective actions or controls to reduce exposure.
- **Medium residual risks** (e.g., operational disruptions): These are actively
  managed with contingency plans in place.
- **Low residual risks** (e.g., minor process inefficiencies): These may be
  tolerated but must still be monitored to prevent escalation.

Risks exceeding the organization’s defined tolerance levels will be escalated to
senior management for review and action.

### Risk Management Framework

Code Town adopts a structured risk management framework to proactively identify,
evaluate, and address risks. The framework includes:

- **Risk identification**: Identifying risks that could affect company
  objectives or operations.
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of
  identified risks using qualitative or quantitative methods.
- **Risk treatment**: Applying appropriate measures to mitigate, transfer,
  accept, or avoid risks.
- **Risk monitoring and reporting**: Continuously tracking risk levels and
  control effectiveness, with regular reporting to senior management.

This risk management process aligns with the company’s overall business strategy
and will be reviewed periodically.

### Risk Identification and Assessment

Employees and managers assess risks regularly and log them in a risk register.
Each risk is evaluated based on:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence.
- **Impact**: Potential severity (e.g., financial loss, reputational damage,
  regulatory penalties).

Risks are rated as high, medium, or low, based on the likelihood and impact
combined.

### Risk Treatment and Mitigation

Once risks are identified and assessed, appropriate strategies are applied to
manage them according to the risk tolerance. Treatment options include:

| **Treatment** | **Description**                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mitigation    | Implementing controls to reduce the risk’s likelihood or impact                                              |
| Avoidance     | Modifying business activities or processes to eliminate the risk entirely                                    |
| Transfer      | Shifting the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)                                            |
| Acceptance    | Recognizing the risk and choosing to accept it if the potential impact is within acceptable tolerance levels |

Each identified risk must have a risk owner and a documented treatment plan,
including deadlines, responsible parties, and required resources.

### Risk Monitoring and Reporting

Risk monitoring occurs continuously, with reviews of control effectiveness on
annual basis.

Any significant changes to risks are updated in the risk register and
communicated to senior management.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
