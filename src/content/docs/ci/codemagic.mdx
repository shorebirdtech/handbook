# Codemagic Workflow Integration

This guide will help you integrate Shorebird into your Codemagic Workflow using the [Codemagic YAML](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Shorebird CLI is installed on your machine

‚úÖ You are logged into a Shorebird account.

:::info
Refer to the [getting started](/) instructions for more information.
:::

## Authentication

<Authentication />

Next, copy the generated `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` and navigate to your Codemagic
secrets via:

1. Go to "Environment Variables"
2. Enter `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` as variable name
3. Paste the token into the variable value field
4. Select or create new group, such as "shorebird"
5. Ensure "Secure" is checked

We recommend using the variable name `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` as it's the default name
used by the Shorebird CLI. If you choose a different name, you'll need to set
the `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` environment variable in your Codemagic workflow manually.

## Codemagic Workflow Editor

Unfortunately, the Codemagic Workflow Editor doesn't support changing the build
command. As a result, you will need to use the [Codemagic YAML](#codemagic-yaml)
file to integrate Shorebird into your workflow.

## Codemagic YAML

If you don't know how to use the Codemagic YAML, please refer to the [Codemagic
YAML documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/yaml-getting-started/).

In the `codemagic.yaml` file, specify the `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` under `environment`.

:::note
Please use the ios build machine in order to build ios releases and patches.

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1
    environment:
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
```

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="maclinux" label="Mac/Linux" default>

1. Add the group "shorebird" to your environment groups. If you're using a
   different group name, use that instead.

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
```

2. If your target is `ios`, you need to specify the code signing mechanism. First you need to setup provisional profile and certificate for that. You may find the setup [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-code-signing/signing-ios/).

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      ios_signing:
        distribution_type: ad_hoc # or app_store | development | enterprise
        bundle_identifier: your package name # for wildcard provisional profiles
```

3. Add a script to your workflow to set up Shorebird. This script will install
   Shorebird and add it to your PATH.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: üê¶ Setup Shorebird
    script: |
      # Install Shorebird
      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

      # Add Shorebird to PATH
      echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
```

4. Execute Shorebird commands in your workflow.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: üöÄ Shorebird Patch
    script: shorebird patch android
```

### Full Example

Here's an example of a complete `codemagic.yaml` file:

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      # if target is ios use below signing configuration
      ios_signing:
       distribution_type: ad_hoc # or app_store | development | enterprise
       bundle_identifier: your package name # for wildcard provisional profiles
      groups:
        - shorebird
      # if your target is ios add signing configuration
      ios_signing:
        distribution_type: ad_hoc # or app_store | development | enterprise
        bundle_identifier: your package name # for wildcard provisional profiles
      flutter: stable
    scripts:
      - name: üê¶ Setup Shorebird
        script: |
          # Install Shorebird
          curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

          # Add Shorebird to PATH
          echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
      - name: üöÄ Shorebird Patch
        #  'shorebird patch ios' if ios
        script: shorebird patch android
```

You can find a working example in this repository:
[codemagic-shorebird-demo](https://github.com/nilsreichardt/codemagic-shorebird-demo)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

1. Add the group containing `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` to your environment groups (in our
   case, the "shorebird" group we created above). Also add a variable named `shorebird`
   with the path to the Shorebird executable.

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
      flutter: stable
      vars:
        # Workaround for
        # https://github.com/orgs/codemagic-ci-cd/discussions/1921#discussioncomment-6582318
        shorebird: "C:\\Users\\builder\\.shorebird\\bin\\shorebird.ps1"
```

2. Add a script to your workflow to set up Shorebird. This script will install
   Shorebird.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: üê¶ Setup Shorebird
    script: |
      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Needed to execute remote scripts
      iwr -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.ps1'|iex
```

3. Run Shorebird commands with `& $env:shorebird` instead of just `shorebird` as a workaround for [codemagic-ci-cd/discussions/1921](https://github.com/orgs/codemagic-ci-cd/discussions/1921#discussioncomment-6582318).

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: üöÄ Shorebird Release
    script: |
      & $env:shorebird release android
```

### Full Example

Here's an example of a complete `codemagic.yaml` file:

```yaml
workflows:
  example:
    name: Example
    environment:
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
      flutter: stable
      vars:
        # Workaround for
        # https://github.com/orgs/codemagic-ci-cd/discussions/1921#discussioncomment-6582318
        shorebird: "C:\\Users\\builder\\.shorebird\\bin\\shorebird.ps1"
    instance_type: windows_x2
    scripts:
      - name: üê¶ Setup Shorebird
        script: |
          Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Needed to execute remote scripts
          iwr -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.ps1'|iex
      - name: üöÄ Shorebird Release
        script: |
          & $env:shorebird release android
```

You can find a working example in this repository:
[codemagic-shorebird-demo](https://github.com/nilsreichardt/codemagic-shorebird-demo/tree/windows)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Example

:::note
If you're using Windows machines, you'll need to adjust the setup
and the execution of Shorebird commands. See the Windows tab above.
:::

If you want to specify the operation type (patch or release) externally, you can
use environment variables in your workflow.

```yaml
workflows:
  advanced-example:
    name: Advanced Example
    environment:
      vars:
        TYPE: 'patch' # Can be 'patch' or 'release'
      groups:
        # Exports the SHOREBIRD_TOKEN environment variable
        - shorebird
      flutter: stable
    scripts:
      - name: üê¶ Setup Shorebird
        script: |
          # Install Shorebird
          curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | bash

          # Add Shorebird to PATH
          echo PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH" >> $CM_ENV
      - name: üôå Shorebird Build
        script: |
          echo "‚û°Ô∏è Using type: $TYPE"

          # If type is neither "patch" nor "release", exit with error
          if [ "$TYPE" != "patch" ] && [ "$TYPE" != "release" ]; then
            echo "TYPE must be either 'patch' or 'release'"
            exit 1
          fi

          # Check type and run corresponding command
          if [ "$TYPE" == "patch" ]; then
            echo "ü©π Running patch command"
            shorebird patch android
          elif [ "$TYPE" == "release" ]; then
            echo "üöÄ Running release command"
            shorebird release android
          fi
```

Now, you can execute the workflow, as shown below:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.codemagic.io/builds' \
--header 'x-auth-token: YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "appId": "YOUR-APP-ID",
    "workflowId": "advanced-example",
    "branch": "main",
    "environment": {
        "variables": {
            "TYPE": "release"
        }
    }
}'
```

This command will run the release command. If you want to run the patch command,
change the `TYPE` variable to `patch`.

To obtain your `x-auth-token`, please follow the [Codemagic API authentication
docs](https://docs.codemagic.io/rest-api/codemagic-rest-api/#authentication).
