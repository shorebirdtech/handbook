description: Integrating Shorebird with Crash Reporting Tools
---

Shorebird uses a fork of Flutter to build your app. This means we've built our
own copy of Flutter's engine which means that the symbols included in the
Flutter.framework or libflutter.so are slightly different from the upstream
Flutter engine.

If you would like to see C++ symbols from our fork of Flutter's engine in your
crash reports, you will need to upload the symbols to your crash reporting tool.

Google provides instructions for how to integrate various crash reporting tools
into your Flutter app:

https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/maintenance/error-reporting

# Getting Symbols from the Console

Shorebird's console provides links to download the symbols for both for your
built app and the Flutter engine in the "Artifacts" tab of the release page.

The current URL format for the console has this tab under:

```
https://console.shorebird.dev/apps/<app-id>/releases/<release-id>
```

# Manual instructions (only needed for CI or scripts)

If you need a way to download symbols as part of a CI pipeline it's possible
with the following information:

For a given Flutter version you will need the Flutter engine hash
to download the symbols. This hash is displayed in `shorebird doctor`
output:

```
$ shorebird doctor
Shorebird 0.24.1 • git@github.com:shorebirdtech/shorebird.git
Flutter 3.16.7 • revision ba46e8490348d6989283c9cff2b95727f0969d04
Engine • revision 974eae888fdedd890b74c84e55a454bb7fcbd7de
```

In this case, we're using `974eae888fdedd890b74c84e55a454bb7fcbd7de` as the
engine hash.

## Symbols for iOS

Assuming engine hash `974eae888fdedd890b74c84e55a454bb7fcbd7de`, the iOS symbols
can be downloaded from the following URL:

## Symbols for Android

Assuming engine hash `974eae888fdedd890b74c84e55a454bb7fcbd7de`, the Android
symbols can be downloaded from the following URLs:
