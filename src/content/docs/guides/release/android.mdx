This guide walks through releasing a code push app to the Google Play Store and applying a patch to that release.

The app we will be releasing in this guide is [`Time Shift`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.shorebird.u_shorebird_clock), our demo code push app. ([source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/time_shift/))

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have an existing Shorebird app. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the [code push quickstart](/guides/code-push-quickstart/) guide.

## Creating a release

### Determine next release version

Navigate to your app on the [Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev/)
to see the current set of releases. For our app, we see that the latest release
version is `1.0.2+5`, so the version of our next release will be `1.0.3+6`.

### Make code changes

Version `1.0.3+6` of Time Shift will change the default clock face from `particle` to `generative`.

To make this change, edit `lib/main.dart`:

```diff
   final clock = ClockFace.values.firstWhere(
     (clock) => clock.name == clockName,
-    orElse: () => ClockFace.particle,
+    orElse: () => ClockFace.generative,
   );
```

Verify that this change does what we expect by running the app with `shorebird run`.

Once this change has been verified, commit this change and push it to GitHub:

```sh
git add lib/main.dart
git commit -m "Change default clock face to generative"
git push
```

[On GitHub](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/time_shift/commit/d1fe9451aa18a775163bce95dd9dab551aaf6259)

### Update app version

Next, bump the app version in `pubspec.yaml`:

```diff
name: time_shift
description: Demo app showing Shorebird updates.
publish_to: "none"

-version: 1.0.2+5
+version: 1.0.3+6

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.19.4 <3.0.0"
```

Commit, tag, and push the change.

```sh
git add pubspec.yaml
git commit -m "Update app version to 1.0.3+6"
git tag v1.0.3+6
git push # Push the commit
git push --tags  # Push the tag
```

### Create a Shorebird release

To create a Shorebird release, run `shorebird release android`. You should see output similar to the following:

```
$ shorebird release android
✓ Building release (17.0s)
✓ Fetching apps (0.3s)
✓ Detecting release version (0.2s)

🚀 Ready to create a new release!

✅ Published Release!

Your next step is to upload the app bundle to the Play Store.
./build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

See the following link for more information:
https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152?hl=en
```

### Upload to the Play Store

As per the instructions above, we must upload the generated `.aab` to the Play Store.

1. Navigate to the [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers).
1. Choose your developer account (for us, it's Shorebird.dev).
1. Select the Time Shift app.
1. Select "Testing -> Open Testing" from the side bar.
1. Click the "Create new release" button.

![CreateNewRelease](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/docs/assets/581764/90c9c7ed-bc39-4731-bfec-524f89e2baf6)

Upload the `.aab` file located at `./build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

1. From the root directory of the project, run `open ./build/app/outputs/bundle/release/` to open the folder containing the `.aab` in Finder.
1. Drag `app-release.aab` into the Play Console to upload.

Once the upload completes, the Play Store will correctly recognize the new version as `6 (1.0.3)`.

![UploadedBundle](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/docs/assets/581764/1994cb5a-4cd6-4f1b-a88c-f5aaa3d1433d)

Click "Next" and then "Save" (both in the bottom-right corner) to submit.

This will take you to the publishing overview page. Click "Submit for review" to submit the release for review.

You should now see a release in the Play Store console with an "In review" status:

![InReview](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/docs/assets/581764/4cfdc7fb-2049-4110-b1cd-da99c7a491f7)

Now you must wait for the Play Store to approve the release.

### Create a GitHub release

It's recommended to create a GitHub release as well.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/shorebirdtech/time_shift/releases.
1. Click "Draft a new release".
1. Choose the tag we created earlier (`v1.0.3+6`).
1. Title the release "v1.0.3+6".
1. Add a description of the release ("Changes the default clock face to 'generative'").
1. Publish the release.

## After the release is approved

Once the release has been approved, you will be able to download it from the Play Store.

## Creating a patch

Patches can be pushed to fix bugs in the `1.0.3+6` release without requiring a new submission to the Play Store.

### Make the change

Start by checking out the `v1.0.3+6` release tag:

```sh
git checkout v1.0.3+6
```

Next, create a branch, as this change will represent a divergence from the `main` branch:

```sh
git checkout -b v1.0.3+6-patch1
```

For the purposes of this guide, we will change the default clock face back to `particle` in `lib/main.dart`:

```diff
     (clock) => clock.name == clockName,
-    orElse: () => ClockFace.generative,
+    orElse: () => ClockFace.particle,
   );
```

Commit the change and push our new patch branch:

```sh
git add lib/main.dart
git commit -m "Change default clock face to particle"
git push --set-upstream origin v1.0.3+6-patch1
```

Tag this commit as `v1.0.3+6-patch1`:

```sh
git tag v1.0.3+6-patch1
git push --tags
```

[On GitHub](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/time_shift/commit/cf4054bada74ff1c5ff84fb9aceb3f1e4442203f)

### Create a Shorebird patch

Finally, push the patch with `shorebird patch android`. You should see output similar to the following:

```
$ shorebird patch android
✓ Building patch (17.2s)
✓ Fetching apps (0.7s)
✓ Detecting release version (0.2s)
✓ Fetching release (99ms)
✓ Fetching Flutter revision (13ms)

```

This patch will now be available to users with version `1.0.3+6` of the app.

### Cleanup

Delete the branch to keep the repository tidy:

```sh
git checkout main
git branch -D v1.0.3+6-patch1
git push origin --delete v1.0.3+6-patch1
```

:::note
This change is still accessible via the `v1.0.3+6-patch1` tag.
