This guide will walk through how to validate a patch in Shorebird's staging environment before promoting the patch to production.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the Shorebird command-line is installed on your machine and that you are logged into an account. Refer to the [getting started](/) instructions for more information.

## Create a Project

:::info
In this guide, we'll go through the process of creating a new project from scratch. To apply these changes to an existing project, skip this step and read ahead.
:::

Create a new project using `flutter create example --empty`.

## Initialize Shorebird

Next, initialize Shorebird in the current project via `shorebird init`.

```sh
shorebird init
```

The generated `shorebird.yaml` should look something like:

```yaml
# Your app_id is not a secret and is just used to identify your app
# when requesting patches from Shorebird's servers.
app_id: ee322dc4-3dc2-4324-90a9-04c40a62ae76
# auto_update controls if Shorebird should automatically update in the background on launch.
# If auto_update: false, you will need to use package:shorebird_code_push to trigger updates.
# https://pub.dev/packages/shorebird_code_push
# Uncomment the following line to disable automatic updates.
# auto_update: false
```

## Create a release

Now that we've created our apps on shorebird, we need to create releases (one for each platform). To create a release, we'll use the `shorebird release` command.

```sh
# Create a release for Android
shorebird release android

# Create a release for iOS
shorebird release ios
```

We can verify the releases were created successfully by visiting [Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev).

You should also [submit the generated app bundles to the Play Store](/guides/release/android#upload-to-the-play-store) and [submit the generated ipa to the App Store](/guides/release/ios#upload-to-the-app-store).

## Creating a patch

Now that we have our releases on the Play Store and App Store, we can create a patch using `shorebird patch`. For the sake of this example, let's set the `backgroundColor` of the `Scaffold` to `Colors.cyan` in `lib/main.dart`:

```diff
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MainApp());
}

class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
+       backgroundColor: Colors.cyan,
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

Now that we've applied the changes, let's create a patch:

```sh
# Stage a patch on Android
shorebird patch android --staging

# Stage a patch on iOS
shorebird patch ios --staging
```

## Preview the release

Next, preview the app release locally on a device or emulator, use `shorebird preview`.

```sh
# Preview the release in the staging environment
shorebird preview --staging --app-id ee322dc4-3dc2-4324-90a9-04c40a62ae76 --release-version 1.0.0+1
```

Shorebird will download the release and run it on your device in the staging environment.

The first time the app is re-launched, we should still see the white `Scaffold` and shorebird will detect and install the patch in the background. Kill and re-launch the app a second time to see the applied patch with the cyan `Scaffold` background.

If all went well, you should see the patch was applied after re-launching the app a second time. Congrats, you've validated your patch in the staging environment ðŸ¥³

## Promote the patch

Now that you have validated the patch, you can push the patch to all devices by promoting it to production from the [Shorebird console](https://console.shorebird.dev). Navigate to the release details page and click on the "Go Live" button.

At this point, you have a setup which allows you to preview patches locally before promoting them to production ðŸŽ‰
