{/* cspell:words libunwind */}

Shorebird is a set of tools that allow you to build and deploy new versions of
your Flutter app directly to your users' devices.

This document exists to explain how Shorebird works and to provide a high-level
overview of the components that make up the Shorebird system.

## Lifetime of a Shorebird Update

This assumes the developer already has installed Shorebird and has a working Flutter
project, as covered in the [Getting Started](/) guide.

`shorebird init` tells Shorebird servers to create a new "App" entry associated
with your account as well as writes the resulting app_id to `shorebird.yaml` in
your project.

`shorebird release` builds your app using `flutter build` and then uploads
the resulting binary to a private Google Cloud Storage bucket. The command
also creates a "release" record in our database that associates the app_id
with the release version.

`shorebird preview` can be used to download and run any of these privately
stored release binaries on your local device.

Developers then typically take the resulting .aab or .ipa and distribute it
to their users, typically via the Play Store or App Store.

At some point later, developers use `shorebird patch` to build a new version
of their app. `shorebird patch` then downloads the previous release binary
associated with that app_id and version number (patches use the same version
number as the release they are patching) and then builds a "patch diff" from
the combined release and patch binaries. This "patch diff" is then uploaded
to a public Google Cloud Storage bucket where it will be served to devices
requesting an update with the corresponding app_id and release version.

`shorebird patch` also creates a record in our database that associates the
patch with the app_id and release version and alerts our "patch check" servers
that a new patch is available. Patches can optionally be "staged" when
uploaded. They will then not appear in patch checks until the patch "channel"
is set to "stable" by the developer in the Shorebird Console.

Release binaries which were built with Shorebird contain Shorebird's updater
library. By default, the updater library will check for patches every time
the app is started. This is done via a background thread to not slow down
launch. The updater code makes a single request to our "patch check" servers
which are again Google Cloud Run instances. The "patch check" servers
respond with the URL of the patch diff if one is available.

A typical patch check is made via https, and contains:

```json
{
  "app_id": "uuid...",
  "channel": "stable",
  "release_version": "1.0.0",
  "patch_number": 1,
  "platform": "android",
  "arch": "arm64-v8a"
}
```

A patch response contains:

```json
{
  "patch_available": true,
  "patch": {
    "number": 1,
    "hash": "sha256...",
    "download_url": "google cloud storage url"
  }
}
```

The code to do these checks is open source as part of the [Shorebird Updater
library](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater/blob/main/library) and may
change from what is documented above:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater/blob/main/library/src/network.rs

The updater library then downloads the patch diff and applies it to the
release binary. The patch diff is a binary diff. The updater library
also checks the hash of the patch diff to confirm download integrity.

The hash is not meant to be a security feature, but rather a way to detect
errors in the patch diff. A common error we see is that developers `shorebird
release` with one source and then actually build and release a different binary,
resulting then in invalid patches. This hash helps detect such errors. We
currently do not sign patches, but plan to add that capability in the near
future.

The modified Flutter engine also reports successful or failed launch of
a patch back to our servers the next time it makes a patch check.

A patch event contains:

```json
{
  "app_id": "uuid...",
  "arch": "arm64-v8a",
  "platform": "android",
  "type": "PatchInstallSuccess",
  "release_version": "1.0.0",
  "patch_number": 1
}
```

These events are used to display patch install analytics in the Shorebird
Console.

If a patch fails to launch after install, in addition to sending a
"PatchInstallFailure" event, the updater library will also mark that patch
number as "bad" locally and refuse to boot the app with that patch number again.
This is to prevent a bad patch from causing a crash loop on the device.

## Shorebird Components and Source Code

Shorebird consists of 3 major parts:

1. The `Shorebird CLI` tool that you use to build and deploy your app from the command line.
1. A modified Flutter engine that is include in your app.
1. Our public-cloud infrastructure which hosts your app's updates.

### The `Shorebird CLI`

The [`shorebird_cli`](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/shorebird_cli)
commands are documented on this site. Most of the build logic is just wrapping
the `flutter` tool and it also adds a few commands to interface with Shorebird's
servers.

### Flutter Modifications

Code push requires technical changes to the underlying Flutter engine. To make
those changes required forking Flutter.

We had to fork 4 Flutter and Dart repositories to make Shorebird work:

#### `flutter/buildroot` "The Buildroot"

The [`flutter/buildroot`](https://github.com/flutter/buildroot) repo contains the build scripts that are used to build the
Flutter engine for various platforms. It's separate from `flutter/engine` in
order to share code and configuration with the Fuchsia build system.

We forked this repository to make several small modifications:

1. Expose our updater symbols from the Flutter engine up to
   `package:shorebird_code_push`

1. Include `libunwind` since the [Shorebird
   Updater](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater) (Rust) code requires it
   for backtraces.

The [Shorebird Updater](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater) is a Rust
library which is linked into the Flutter engine via a static library
(`libupdater.a`) that exposes a C API.

Because the default Flutter engine linking flags hide all symbols from linked
static libraries, and because we need to be able to expose the `shorebird\_\*`
symbols from `libupdater.a` to the Dart code, we made one change to `buildroot`
and then a second change to the `engine` to place the symbols on the allow-list.

:::note
You can see our buildroot changes on GitHub by
comparing our trunk to the upstream buildroot, e.g. master:
https://github.com/flutter/buildroot/compare/master...shorebirdtech:buildroot:shorebird/dev
:::

#### `flutter/engine` "The Flutter Engine"

The [`flutter/engine`](https://github.com/flutter/engine/) repo contains C++
code that runs on the device. It is responsible for rendering the UI, handling
input, and communicating with the host.

We forked this code to add the
[Shorebird Updater](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/updater), which lets the
Flutter engine load new code from Shorebird's servers.

:::note
Our Flutter Engine fork is public. You can see our engine changes on GitHub by
comparing our trunk to the upstream Flutter engine, e.g. for 3.22.0:
https://github.com/flutter/engine/compare/3.22.0...shorebirdtech:engine:shorebird/dev
:::

#### `flutter/flutter` "The Flutter Framework"

The [`flutter/flutter`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/) repo contains the Dart code that runs on the device as well
as the `flutter` tool that is used to build and run Flutter apps.

We forked this code to be able to deliver our modified Flutter engine to change
the version of the engine that the `flutter` tool uses and to include the
`shorebird.yaml` configuration as part of the asset bundle.

:::note
Our Flutter Framework fork is public. You can see our engine changes on GitHub
by comparing our trunk to the upstream Flutter Framework, e.g. for stable:
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/compare/stable...shorebirdtech:flutter:shorebird/dev
:::

#### `dart-lang/sdk` "The Dart SDK"

The [`dart-lang/sdk`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/) repo contains the Dart
SDK, including the VM, dart2js, core libraries, and more.

We forked this code in order to teach Dart how to run modified (patched) code in
an interpreter while being able to run all unmodified code on the CPU.

:::note
Our Dart SDK fork is private currently. It will likely be public in the future
and we will work to upstream many our changes as the team grows and the product
matures.
:::

#### Installing a Forked Flutter

When you install Shorebird, it installs Flutter and Dart from our fork. These
are currently not exposed on the user's path, rather private copies that
Shorebird will use when building your app.

This was necessary to avoid conflicts with other Flutter installations on the
user's machine. Specifically, the way that Flutter downloads artifacts is based
on the version of the engine. If we were to use the same version of the engine
as the user's Flutter installation, then we would overwrite the user's engine
artifacts.

We deliver our artifacts to this fork of Flutter with two ways. First is we
change the version of the engine in the `flutter` tool. Second is we pass
`FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` set to `download.shorebird.dev` (instead of
`download.flutter.io`) when calling our vended copy of the `flutter` tool.

Currently this means `shorebird` will not work in an environment where the
user needs to use `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to download Flutter artifacts
from a private mirror (e.g. a corporate network or China).

#### Serving Forked Binaries

We also use a custom server to handle requests from `flutter` for our
modified engine. The source for that server is here:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/artifact_proxy

The artifact proxy is hosted at https://download.shorebird.dev via Google Cloud Run.

This proxy knows how to serve the modified binaries from our Google Storage
bucket, as well as how to forward along requests to Google's Flutter storage
bucket for unmodified binaries for all parts of Flutter we didn't have to
modify.

### Shorebird's Cloud Infrastructure

Shorebird's public-cloud based infrastructure is responsible for hosting your
app's updates. It's a set of services that handle the following:

- Release binary (private) storage
- Patch binary (public) storage and serving (via global CDN)
- Patch check requests (via Google Cloud Run)

We also provide a web-based console for developers to manage their apps and
view analytics as well as the underlying database that powers the patch checks
and console.

Currently all of our infrastructure is hosted on Google Cloud Platform although
we will likely expand to other cloud providers over time. If we do, we will
update our privacy policy to reflect such. All of these services are currently
set to use US regions by default.
