## Purpose and Scope

Security is a shared responsibility across Code Town. All employees are expected
to act with professional judgment based on standards and prior experience. In
uncertain situations, seek guidance.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who
access Code Town's information systems and data.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following sections outline key expectations for protecting Code Town's data,
systems, and security, covering guidelines for handling information, securing
accounts, devices, and communications, and maintaining both physical and digital
security.

### Data Handling, Classification, and Privacy

All employees must handle company data carefully and according to its
classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Secret), including considering
these points:

- Confidential or Secret data should never be shared without proper
  authorization.
- Employees should access only the data necessary for their role, never use it
  for personal purposes, and report any potential data breaches immediately.
- Misclassification of data should also be reported to supervisors.

### Account and Device Security

Employees are responsible for securing their work accounts and devices. This
includes using strong, unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication
(MFA), and locking workstations when unattended.

Company-approved devices and software must be used, kept up-to-date with the
latest security patches, and connected to the company VPN when using public
networks.

Report any suspicious activity, lost/stolen devices, or unauthorized software
installations immediately.

### Communication and Remote Work Security

Employees must use caution when handling communications such as emails,
attachments, and file-sharing:

- Do not send sensitive information via unencrypted email, and use only
  company-approved methods for file transfers.
- Be vigilant about phishing attempts and other suspicious communications.

When working remotely, employees must use secure Wi-Fi networks, and ensure that
their work environment protects the confidentiality of company data.

### Physical Security and Clean Desk Policy

Keep sensitive documents out of plain sight, follow the Clean Desk Policy by
securely storing them when not in use, and dispose of sensitive materials
through approved methods like shredding. Report any unauthorized individuals or
suspicious activities immediately.

Given the fact that we are a remote first company this should apply to any place
that you are actively using as your work environment.

### Compliance, Reporting, and Social Media

All employees must complete security training on time and stay informed about
relevant policies. Report policy violations, security concerns, or breaches to
supervisors or the IT department. Cooperate fully with internal or external
audits.

Social media activities should not disclose any confidential company
information, and employees must avoid speaking on behalf of the company without
authorization.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
