## Purpose and Scope

This Vulnerability and Patch Management Policy establishes a framework for
identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in Code Town's
information systems. It aims to reduce security risks, maintain system
integrity, and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

This policy applies to all information systems, networks, and applications owned
or operated by Code Town, as well as all employees, contractors, and third
parties responsible for managing these systems.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following sections outline how Code Town manages the identification and
remediation of vulnerabilities.

### Bug Bounty & Vulnerability Program

We do not currently offer a bug bounty & vulnerability program. We welcome
reports of security vulnerabilities. Information on found bugs or
vulnerabilities can be sent to contact@shorebird.dev. Only reports will
sufficient details (steps to reproduce, stated cause, possible remedies) will be
investigated. We will respond to reports based on our assessment criteria which
can be found later in this document.

### Vulnerability and Patch Management Process

Code Town adopts a structured process for vulnerability and patch management to
ensure vulnerabilities are identified and remediated before they can be
exploited. This process includes:

- **Vulnerability identification**: Proactively scanning and monitoring systems
  for known vulnerabilities using approved tools and services.
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Assessing the criticality of identified
  vulnerabilities based on their potential impact on systems, data, and
  operations.
- **Patch management**: Applying security patches and updates to address
  vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential risk.
- **Testing and validation**: Testing patches in a controlled environment to
  ensure they do not negatively affect system performance or functionality
  before deployment.

### Vulnerability Identification and Assessment

Three processes are relevant to identify vulnerabilities:

- Automatic security scans doing continuous monitoring on production systems
- Static analysis and dependency management tooling
- Regular penetration testing performed by a third party

Each identified vulnerability is assigned a priority or severity level to the
issue to signal its urgency:

| Sev Rating | Priority Level | TTR       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P0         | Critical       | 7 days    | Vulnerabilities that can cause a direct, immediate impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. Exploitation typically requires little to no user interaction and can lead to complete system compromise. | Vulnerabilities that result in Remote Code Execution such as Vertical Authentication bypass, SSRF, XXE, SQL Injection, User authentication bypass |
| P1         | High           | 30 days   | Vulnerabilities that can cause a significant impact, but might have some mitigating factors such as requiring user interaction or being more difficult to exploit than P0 vulnerabilities.                                          | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), XML External Entity (XXE), Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)                                                            |
| P2         | Medium         | 90 days   | Vulnerabilities that pose a moderate risk. They might not lead to full system compromise or require specific conditions to be exploitable.                                                                                          | Reflected XSS, Exposed Administration Panels, Open Redirects, Insecure Direct Object References                                                   |
| P3         | Low            | As Needed | Vulnerabilities that pose a limited risk to the system, often due to the limited scope of impact, difficulty in exploitation, or minimal potential damage.                                                                          | Improper Information Disclosure, Missing Security Headers, Lack of Secure Flags on Cookies                                                        |

Documentation of vulnerability findings should be preserved for a minimum of 5
years.

### Patch Management and Remediation

Once vulnerabilities are identified and assessed, the following patch management
activities take place:

- **Patch prioritization**: Vulnerabilities will be patched within the set TTR.
- **Regular patching cycles**: All systems will be patched during regularly
  scheduled maintenance windows to address medium and low-priority
  vulnerabilities.
- **Emergency patches**: In cases of immediate risk (e.g., zero-day
  vulnerabilities), emergency patches will be deployed outside of regular
  patching cycles, following testing and approval.
- **Third-party software patches**: Ensure that third-party applications and
  services are patched according to vendor advisories and within the same
  criticality framework.

Document and approve any exceptions to patching timeframes and implement
compensating controls for systems that cannot be patched. Regularly review and
reassess all exceptions.

### Testing and Validation

All patches will be tested in a non-production environment to ensure they do not
introduce new vulnerabilities or degrade system performance.

After patches are applied, systems will be monitored to verify that the patch
has been successfully deployed and that no adverse effects have occurred.

### Monitoring and Reporting

Monitoring and reporting are essential for tracking the effectiveness of
vulnerability and patch management processes. This includes:

- **Patch status monitoring**: Tracking the patch status of all systems to
  ensure they are up to date.
- **Vulnerability reports**: Generating regular vulnerability assessment reports
  for senior management to highlight outstanding vulnerabilities and patch
  deployment status.

In the event of an exploited vulnerability, the incident will be escalated and
managed as per Code Townâ€™s incident response plan.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
