## Overview

All access to Code Town's physical locations are governed by this policy and
managed by the leadership team. The policy aims to ensure that access to the
office is secured and restricted to authorized individuals to protect our
employees, data, and assets from unauthorized access or potential security
breaches.

The entirety of the Code Town application is hosted on Cloud Services such as
Google Cloud. These cloud providers maintain documentation surrounding their
physical security controls, and the Code Town team reviews this documentation
yearly to ensure it is compliant with Code Town security requirements.

## Policy Statements

1. Employees must ensure their home internet is secure. Use of WPA2 encryption
   on Wi-Fi networks is required.
2. Employee work devices must be stored securely when not in use to prevent
   theft or unauthorized access.
3. Employees must report lost or stolen devices immediately to the leadership
   team. The lost or stolen device will be deactivated, and a new device will be
   issued.
4. Employees should be mindful of visitors in their home workspace and take
   steps to prevent over-the-shoulder access to sensitive information.
5. Employees must follow company procedures for the secure disposal of sensitive
   documents and data, using shredders or secure deletion tools as appropriate
6. Employees must report any suspicious behavior or security incidents to the
   leadership team or the Facility Management Team immediately.

## Controls and Procedures

### Pandemic Readiness

In the event of a pandemic, Code Town will follow the guidance and
recommendations provided by local, state, and federal health authorities to
ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. As a fully remote company,
Code Town is well-positioned to maintain business continuity during a pandemic.
However, we recognize that our employees may face additional challenges, such as
increased family responsibilities or potential health concerns.

Employees are encouraged to communicate any concerns or challenges they face
during a pandemic to their manager or the leadership team. We will work with
employees to provide the necessary support and accommodations to ensure their
well-being and ability to continue working effectively.

The leadership team will regularly communicate with employees about any updates
to company policies, health and safety measures, and business continuity plans
during a pandemic. If an employee's home workspace becomes unsuitable or unsafe
during a pandemic, the company will work with the employee to find an
alternative solution, such as providing additional equipment or assisting in
finding a temporary alternative workspace.
