## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of encryption
and key management to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of sensitive data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
Intellectual Property (IP), and other classified data.

This policy covers all employees, contractors, and third parties involved in the
processing, storage, or transmission of encrypted data, as well as the
management of cryptographic keys.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements outline how we implement and manage encryption
and key management processes to protect our information assets. They cover
everything from encryption standards to key lifecycle management.

### Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted with TLS 1.3 or higher when transmitted over
untrusted networks. For data at rest, AES-256 or equivalent encryption is used
for sensitive data storage.

Only secure, industry-recognized encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, TLS) are
used and deprecated algorithms are prohibited.

### Key Management

A secure key management system is used for the entire key lifecycle (generation,
distribution, storage, rotation, revocation).

Keys must be generated securely and stored in key vaults. Private keys cannot be
stored with encrypted data.

All shared or production access tokens are documented in a key inventory with at
least the following information:

- Key Creator
- Service description
- Creation Date
- Last rotated date
- Current Key Owner

All keys that have access to production data or customer confidential data must
be rotated at least every 90 days. All personal access keys that have access to
any staging or test environments must be rotated at least annually.

Keys must be backed up securely for recovery in case of data loss.

### Monitoring and Auditing

Key usage, encryption events, and unauthorized activities are monitored and
tracked. Alerts are triggered for unauthorized access or anomalies.

Regular audits of key management and encryption processes are mandatory to
ensure compliance.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
