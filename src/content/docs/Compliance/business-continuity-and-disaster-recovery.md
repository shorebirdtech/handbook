## Purpose and Scope

The Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Policy establishes
procedures that will enable Code Town to restore business operations expediently
following disruptions such as cyber incidents, system failures, or other
unforeseen challenges

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party providers
involved in business continuity and disaster recovery activities.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

This policy outlines our approach to safeguarding critical functions and systems
through effective business continuity and disaster recovery planning.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is conducted regularly to:

- Identify critical business functions, systems, and processes.
- Assess potential financial, operational, and reputational impacts of
  disruptions.
- Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for
  each critical system and function, ensuring that downtime and data loss are
  minimized.

### Business Continuity Planning

Business continuity plans (BCPs) are developed for all critical functions and
processes identified in the BIA. These plans include:

- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clear assignment of personnel responsible for
  executing the plan.
- **Communication Protocols**: Procedures for internal and external
  communication during an incident, including contact lists and communication
  templates.
- **Workaround Solutions**: Temporary solutions to keep critical services
  running if normal operations are disrupted.
- **Resource Requirements**: Details of resources (staff, equipment, facilities)
  required to execute the plan.

### Disaster Recovery Planning

Disaster recovery plans (DRPs) are developed for all critical IT systems and
data, and include:

- **Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step processes for restoring systems and data
  after an outage.
- **Backup Strategies**: Details of backup schedules and storage locations,
  ensuring that all critical data is regularly backed up and securely stored.
- **RTO and RPO Alignment**: Recovery procedures aligned with the defined RTO
  and RPO to restore critical systems within acceptable timeframes.
- **Testing of Recovery Procedures**: At least annual testing to confirm that
  recovery processes work as expected in real-world scenarios.

### Plan Maintenance and Review

Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery plans must be reviewed and updated
annually or after any significant organizational or operational change.
Additionally, after any major disruption the planâ€™s effectiveness has to be
evaluated and any improvements have to be identified.

All updates must be documented and version-controlled for auditing purposes.

### Incident Response and Escalation

Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery plans are fully integrated with the
Incident Response Plan to include elements such as incident escalation,
coordination, and post-incident review.

### Training and Awareness

All employees involved in Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery activities
must undergo annual training to familiarize themselves with their roles and
responsibilities.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.

### Phase Definition

1. **Notification/Activation Phase**

   a. Incident Detection: Implement comprehensive monitoring systems to detect
   anomalies in real-time, including network activity, system performance, and
   application behavior.

   b. Assessment:

   - Once an incident is detected, immediately convene a response team to assess
     the severity, potential impact, and categorize the incident type (e.g.,
     hardware failure, cyber-attack, natural disaster).
   - Communicate the incident assessment to all relevant stakeholders.

   c. Plan Activation:

   - Based on the assessment, activate the appropriate business continuity or
     disaster recovery procedure, specifying roles and responsibilities, and
     initiate the response protocol.
   - Notify customers, if necessary, based on the incident's impact, adhering to
     any legal or regulatory requirements regarding breach notification.

2. **Recovery Phase**

   a. Establish Temporary IT Operations:

   - Redirect network traffic to backup systems or utilize cloud-based services
     to maintain business operations.
   - Retrieve data from off-site backups or cloud storage to facilitate
     temporary operations.
   - Establish a temporary helpdesk or communication channel for users
     experiencing issues.

   b. Damage Recovery:

   - Initiate damage control measures to prevent further loss, such as isolating
     affected systems, applying emergency patches, or shutting down specific
     services.
   - Start system restoration processes using backups, ensuring data integrity
     and security.
   - Continuously communicate progress updates to stakeholders and customers as
     appropriate.
   - Prioritize system restoration based on the predefined RTO and RPO, focusing
     on critical systems, functions and processes first.
   - Continuously monitor the recovery progress against the RTO and RPO, and
     adjust the recovery strategy if necessary to meet the objectives.

3. **Reconstitution Phase**

   a. System Restoration:

   - Once the ongoing disruption is mitigated, begin the process of restoring
     full services from the temporary operations to the primary systems.
   - Conduct a thorough system audit and verification to ensure all systems are
     secure and fully operational.
   - Confirm the integrity and confidentiality of data, ensuring no unauthorized
     alterations were made.

   b. Return to Normal Operations:

   - Formally document the return to normal operations and communicate this to
     all stakeholders.
   - Gradually phase out temporary measures and ensure users experience a smooth
     transition back to regular operations.

   c. Post-Incident Review:

   - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand the root cause of the
     incident, the effectiveness of the BCDR plan, and areas that require
     improvement.
   - Update the BCDR plan based on lessons learned and improve training,
     resources, and protocols as necessary.
   - Share relevant incident details and lessons learned with stakeholders and,
     where appropriate, the broader community to help prevent future incidents.
