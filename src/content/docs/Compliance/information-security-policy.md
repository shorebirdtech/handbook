assets by:

  and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to restrict access to systems and
  sensitive data.
- Data encryption and protection: Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in
  transit to prevent unauthorized access, along with data loss prevention (DLP)
  technologies.
- System hardening and patch management: Applying secure configurations, timely
  system updates, and regular vulnerability scanning to reduce the risk of
  compromise.
- Network and endpoint security: Using firewalls, intrusion detection and
  prevention systems, and endpoint protection tools to monitor and defend
  against threats.

  and respond to unauthorized activities or system anomalies in real-time.

  recovery procedures to ensure business continuity.
