## Purpose and Scope

This Password Policy establishes guidelines and requirements for password
creation, management, and use at Code Town. It aims to enhance the security of
our information systems and data by promoting strong password practices.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who have
access to Code Town's systems and data.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements outline how Code Town manages password security
to protect its assets and information.

### Password Creation and Authentication

Where possible, employees should avoid creating a username and password pair,
and instead utilize Single Sign-On (SSO) via Google Workspace to log into
services. Default passwords must be changed upon first use. Employees must
create strong passwords that meet the following criteria:

- Randomly generated
- Minimum length of 12 characters
- Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special
  characters
- At least one non-alphanumeric character
- Avoid common words, phrases, or personal information
- Passwords must not contain any personal data that could identify the user
- Passwords must be unique and not used for any other account, personal or
  professional

Code Town enforces password complexity requirements through technical controls
and passwords are checked against a list of commonly used or compromised
passwords.

### Account Lockout

User accounts will be locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts.

All failed login attempts and account lockouts are logged and monitored for
potential security incidents.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is required for:

- All access to Code Town's cloud systems
- Access to sensitive systems or data
- Access to our password manager, 1Password

### Password Storage and Transmission

All passwords must be stored in an encrypted format using industry-standard
encryption algorithms.

Encryption keys are managed securely, with access restricted to authorized
personnel only. Key rotation is performed regularly.

### Shared Accounts and Service Accounts

The use of shared accounts is prohibited. Service account passwords must be
changed whenever a team member with knowledge of the password leaves the
organization.

Service account usage is logged and monitored. Regular audits are performed to
review the necessity and access levels of service accounts.

### Password Managers

Code Town provides and encourages the use of a company-approved password
manager, specifically 1Password. Employees should use the password manager to
generate and store complex, unique passwords for each account.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
