## Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes requirements for logging and monitoring of Code Town's
information systems to detect security events, maintain operational visibility,
and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

This policy applies to all information systems, networks, and applications owned
or operated by Code Town, as well as all employees, contractors, and third
parties with access to these systems.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements outline our core commitments and practices for
logging and monitoring. They cover everything from log collection and retention
to analysis and incident detection.

### Logging and Monitoring Framework

Code Town will implement a centralized logging and monitoring framework that
captures and analyzes system activities across all critical IT assets. The
framework includes:

- **Log collection**: Gathering logs from servers, applications, network
  devices, and cloud platforms.
- **Log analysis**: Regularly reviewing and analyzing logs to detect anomalous
  or suspicious activities.
- **Alerting**: Configuring automated alerts for specific triggers, such as
  unauthorized access attempts or system failures.
- **Retention**: Storing logs securely and retaining them for a specified period
  based on regulatory, legal, and business requirements.

### Log Types and Sources

The following log types are collected and monitored to ensure comprehensive
coverage of system activities:

- **Security logs**: Capturing login attempts, failed authentication, and system
  access violations.
- **Application logs**: Monitoring events related to the functioning and
  performance of applications, including errors and abnormal behavior.
- **System logs**: Tracking operating system events such as boot sequences,
  shutdowns, and system errors.
- **Network logs**: Capturing network traffic events, including firewall,
  router, and switch logs.
- **Audit logs**: Documenting user activities and system changes for compliance
  and auditing purposes.

Logs must be configured to capture sufficient details, including timestamps, IP
addresses, user IDs, and event types, to facilitate incident investigation and
audit. All systems generating logs must be synchronized to a reliable and
consistent time source to ensure accurate time stamping of events.

### Log Monitoring and Analysis

Logs will be actively monitored for suspicious behavior, security incidents, and
operational failures. This process includes:

- **Automated log analysis**: Using tools and systems to automate the monitoring
  of logs for predefined security and operational event triggers.
- **Alerting and escalation**: Setting up automated alerts for critical events
  such as unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, or system failures.
  Alerts must be escalated according to the organizationâ€™s incident response
  process.
- **Log correlation**: Correlating logs from multiple systems to detect complex
  attacks or patterns of suspicious behavior across the network.

### Log Retention and Storage

Logs will be retained for a minimum of 12 months.

Logs must be stored in secure locations, using encryption and access control
mechanisms to protect them from unauthorized access or tampering. They must be
protected from modification or deletion.

The retention policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with
changes in regulatory or business requirements.

### Incident Response and Forensic Investigation

Logs are a critical source of information for responding to security incidents
and conducting forensic investigations. In the event of a security breach or
operational failure, the IT Security Team will:

- **Analyze relevant logs**: Review logs to identify the source and scope of the
  incident.
- **Correlate events**: Use log correlation to track the progression of the
  incident across systems.
- **Generate reports**: Produce detailed reports for incident response, root
  cause analysis, and corrective action planning.

Logs must be preserved for forensic purposes in the event of an investigation or
legal proceedings.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
