## Purpose and Scope

This Secure Development Policy establishes guidelines and requirements for
secure software development practices at Code Town. It aims to integrate
security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to minimize
vulnerabilities and protect company and customer data.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties involved in
software development activities.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

These following policy statements outline our approach to integrating security
from initial design through deployment and ongoing maintenance.

Security must be integrated into every phase of the SDLC, including requirements
gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

### Secure Development Environment

All developers must use company-approved development tools and platforms.
Multi-factor authentication is enabled for all development accounts to prevent
unauthorized access.

Development environments must be isolated from production data to minimize the
risk of data breaches.

### Code Security

All software developed must follow secure coding standards to prevent common
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer
overflows. To maintain high standards:

- Implement input validation for all data inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without revealing sensitive information
- Apply the principle of least privilege in code implementation

### Code Review and Static Analysis

All code changes must:

- Undergo peer review with a specific focus on security
- Pass static code analysis before being merged
- Address all high and critical security issues identified during review or
  analysis

Regular code reviews help catch security issues early and spread security
knowledge across the team.

### Security Testing

Developers are responsible for writing and running unit tests that cover
security functionality. Integration tests should include scenarios that verify
security controls are working as expected.

### Secure Source Code Management

Use version control systems for all source code. Implement branch protection
rules to prevent direct commits to main branches. Regularly audit repository
access and remove outdated permissions.

Ensure that sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates
are never committed to the repository. Use environment variables or secure
secret management systems to handle sensitive data.

### Secure Deployment

Security considerations extend to the deployment process:

- Use automated, repeatable deployment processes to minimize human error
- Implement separation of duties between development and deployment
- Use immutable infrastructure where possible to ensure consistency

Regularly review and update our deployment processes to align with industry best
practices and emerging threats.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
