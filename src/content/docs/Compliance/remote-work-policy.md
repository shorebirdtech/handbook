## Purpose and Scope

This Remote Work Policy establishes guidelines for securing Code Town's assets
and sensitive information in remote work environments. This is a key policy
given that we are a remote first company. It aims to maintain security and
confidentiality while employees work from various locations outside of
traditional office spaces.

This policy applies to all Code Town employees, contractors, and authorized
third parties engaged in remote work activities.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements outline how Code Town manages physical security
measures in remote work environments to protect its assets and information.

### Work Environment and Equipment

Employees working remotely are responsible for maintaining a professional and
secure workspace to protect company assets and data. Code Town will provide the
necessary tools and resources for remote work.

Key requirements:

- **Workplace setup**: Employees must work in a private, secure space to prevent
  unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Company-provided equipment**: All company-issued equipment (e.g., laptops,
  monitors) must be used for work purposes only and should not be shared with
  non-employees.
- **Personal equipment**: If personal devices are used for work, they must meet
  company security standards, including encryption, antivirus software, and
  regular updates.

Any issues with equipment or software must be reported immediately to the IT
department to ensure timely resolution and minimal disruption to work.

### Data Security and Confidentiality

All employees must follow data security policies to protect sensitive
information, such as:

- **Secure file storage**: Sensitive information must be stored on approved
  cloud platforms, never on local devices or unauthorized storage solutions.
- **Data encryption**: All data transmitted between remote workstations and
  company systems must be encrypted to prevent interception by unauthorized
  parties.
- **Confidentiality**: Employees are responsible for safeguarding confidential
  information. This includes ensuring that sensitive conversations are conducted
  in private and that unauthorized individuals do not have access to screens or
  files.

### Access Control

Remote workers must ensure that family members, roommates, or visitors do not
have access to company devices or sensitive information. Screen locks and device
passwords must be used at all times.

For systems accessing highly sensitive data, multi-factor authentication is
required. Remote workers must log off or lock their devices when stepping away,
even for short periods.

### Internet and Network Security

Remote employees must use secure Wi-Fi networks protected by strong passwords.
Public or unsecured networks (e.g., cafes, airports) should be avoided unless
using a VPN.

Personal networks and devices must have firewalls and antivirus software enabled
and regularly updated.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.
