## Purpose and Scope

This Network Security Policy establishes guidelines and requirements for
securing Code Town's network infrastructure, protecting it from unauthorized
access, misuse, modification, or denial of service.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who use or
manage Code Town's network resources.

## Policy Statements: Our Commitments

The following policy statements describe our approach to protecting our network
infrastructure from various threats. They encompass all aspects of network
security, from architecture and access control to monitoring and incident
response.

### Network Architecture and Security Controls

Code Town implements:

- A secure network architecture with clearly defined security zones per our
  cloud service providers recommendations.
- Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other
  security controls to protect the network perimeter.
- Controls to protect against malware, including up-to-date antivirus software
  on all systems.

### Access Control and Data Protection

Strong access controls, including multi-factor authentication for access and
privileged accounts, are implemented. A formal process for granting, modifying,
and revoking network access rights is maintained.

Encryption is used for sensitive data transmission over networks.

### Monitoring, Maintenance, and Incident Response

Network traffic and system logs are continuously monitored for suspicious
activities and security incidents. An incident response plan is maintained to
address and mitigate network security incidents promptly.

Network devices, operating systems, and applications are regularly updated, via
our cloud service providers, and are patched to address known vulnerabilities.

### Documentation and Change Management

The organization verifies that:

- All network configurations are documented and stored securely.
- A formal change management process governs all network changes.
- Network device configurations undergo regular backups through the tools
  provided by our cloud service providers.

### Network Resilience and Availability

Critical network components are deployed in redundant configurations to
eliminate single points of failure. Load balancing is implemented for key
services to enhance performance and availability.

Regular capacity assessments are conducted to confirm network resources meet
current and projected demand.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and
third parties with access to Code Town's data.

In rare cases, business needs, local laws, or regulations may require
exceptions. Management will approve any exceptions and define alternative
solutions.

Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, as per
Code Town's policies.

## Policy Review and Maintenance

This policy will be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to
maintain its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness.

Reviews must consider changes in the regulatory landscape.
