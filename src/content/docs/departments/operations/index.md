The Operations team exists to ensure Code Town Inc runs smoothly as a business.
We handle the non-engineering work that keeps the company healthy, compliant,
funded, and growing. Our mission is to remove friction, provide clarity, and
enable the engineering and product organizations to focus on building and
shipping great products.

## Core Principals

- Bias for clarity — Make information discoverable and processes explicit.
- Default to automation — If we do it more than twice, we automate or template
  it.
- Lightweight, not bureaucratic — Create only the process needed, never more.
- Small team, big output — Operate like a force multiplier for the entire
  company.
