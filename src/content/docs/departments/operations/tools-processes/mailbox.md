As a company we do end up having to receive physical mail. In order to do this
in a remote company we utilize [Stable](https://www.usestable.com) as our
mailbox provider.

## Mailbox Access

Currently only Eric and Tom have access to this account. We can add users as
needed for a fee. Before attempting to add users talk to the Operations team
with a reason for it long term. We should be able to forward or extract PDF's
for content needed to share rather then add more users.

## Process

Should be pretty simple as there isn't much mail that comes in but this process
does need to be followed in a timely manner to ensure business critical
information is dealt with quickly.

### Triage

**Target** - Within 24 hours of new mail notice.

**Steps to Execute** - Click the Scan button on the email that is received.

### Tag & Action

**Target** - Within 24 hours of new mail being scanned.

**Steps to Execute**

1. Review Mail - Once we have the scan, review it.
2. Add a tag - Typically a piece of mail will be tagged with information for who
   it was sent by and what it pertains to.
   - Example - When getting a new tax bill from the state of California the tags
     "State - California" and "Taxes" should be applied.
3. Assign/Take Action/Follow up as needed - We keep the item in the mailbox
   until it is fully acted on/completed. Currently we don't have an assignment
   field for a person but may be something we add if the volume goes up. For now
   Tom is the point person for this.

### Archive

**Target** - Within 1 week of mail being scanned, within 24 hours of action
being completed.

**Steps to Execute** - After ensuring the mail is tagged and completed, archive
the mail.
