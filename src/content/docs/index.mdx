:::info
Installing Shorebird CLI requires `git`.
:::

This installs `shorebird` into `~/.shorebird/bin` and adds it to your `PATH`. It
also installs a copy of Flutter and Dart inside
`~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`. The copy of Flutter is slightly modified to
add Shorebird code push and is not intended to be added to your `PATH`. You can
continue to use the versions of Flutter and Dart you already have installed.

:::info
The total installation is about 300mb.
:::

Once the installation has completed, `shorebird` should be available in your
terminal:

```
$ shorebird
