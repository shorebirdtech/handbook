# Discounts

We estimate that as of March 2025, less than 3% of all Flutter developers have
ever tried Shorebird. Maybe as many as 5-10% of all Flutter developers have
ever heard of Shorebird. Our primary goal for the next several years is to
grow usage and awareness of the product. Through such, revenues (and thus
sustainability of the business will also grow).

Price is not intended to be an obstacle for adoption at this time. I'm certain
our prices are "wrong" and will change many times in the coming years.

Our prices, as we have currently set them, are (intentionally) low relative to
our costs of providing the service. Although we price based on usage, 90% of our
costs do not relate to usage, but rather development of the product(s) and sales
and procurement support there-of. Thus discounting our usage-based pricing is
somewhat immaterial relative to the cost of providing the service, but does
affect our bottom line in the long run.

General Principles:
- In almost all cases, we would rather have a user on a discount than not have a
  user.
- We have so many users to service, alacrity is preferred over accuracy.
- Discounts are an exception rather than a rule.  If most of our sales need
  discounts, we should adjust our pricing.
- Discounts should be time-limited to 6mo or less, 1y on exception. (For both
  accounting/MMR tracking and as a cause to re-visit.)
- Provide discounts to non-profit, or low-income-country users when prompted,
  even on our Pro plan.
- Use trials instead of discounts for business and enterprise users.
- Use pre-made Stripe coupons for discounts.
- Discounts should be limited in total spend (e.g. $100), beyond that it's a
  price adjustment or Trial.
- Business sales should not lead with discounts.  Our Enterprise pricing already
  includes discounted rates within the pricing plan.  Furthermore, more often
  we've found our prices are too-low for some established businesses (cause
  confusion during procurement).  We can always negotiate around discounts
  deeper in the procurement process.
