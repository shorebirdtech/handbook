We estimate that as of March 2025, less than 3% of all Flutter developers have
ever tried Shorebird. Maybe as many as 5-10% of all Flutter developers have
ever heard of Shorebird. Our primary goal for the next several years is to
grow usage and awareness of the product. Through such, revenues and thus
sustainability of the business will also grow.

## Tools

### Email/Calendar

As described in [onboarding](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/onboarding/#accounts) we use Google Workspace for our Email & Calendar. This allows you to use any other services and/or apps that you typically would to stay organized.

### Calendly

We do have a Shorebird [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) account. On a personal basis, this is useful for adding a "book time with me" link to your email signature. We also use the [Round Robin](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402432846999-Round-robin-distribution-overview) feature for the "Contact Sales" buttons on the website. This allows us to spread the sales calls out to a team rather then just filling up one persons calendar all the time.

If you think you need access to Calendly reach out to the Operations team.

### CRM

We use [Attio](https://app.attio.com) to track our customer interactions and sales flow. Anyone that regularly interacts with customers, especially via email, should have an Attio account. This will ensure that our communication flow is automatically tracked and viewable by other team members to avoid the cross talk problem of multiple people having multiple conversations with the same person/company. This tracking is done via the [Email and Calendar Sync](https://attio.com/help/reference/email-calendar/email-and-calendar-syncing), (setup details are on the [Attio reference site](https://attio.com/help/reference/attio-101/syncing-people-and-companies)) that Attio provides along with manual & workflow entry of [Tasks](https://attio.com/help/reference/productivity-collaborating/tasks) on Companies and Deals.

#### Data We Track

Overall there are 2 main things that we need to keep track of: 1) People & Companies and 2) Deals

##### People & Companies

Most of this tracking is done for you by Attio automatically through Email and Calendar tracking. If you have connected your Shorebird Google Account to Attio then it will view your emails and appointments and auto populate records for Companies and People.

##### Deals

## Pricing

We are certain our prices are currently "wrong" for the market we are selling to and will change
many times in the coming years as we learn what works and what doesn't.

**Price is not intended to be an obstacle for adoption at this time.** We want to grow our user base so if we have the ability to apply coupons, discounts, etc for a prospective customer to meet their pricing limits please come up with a proposal and run it by the Operations lead before approaching a customer with options. We want to ensure that we are not losing money on a deal/customer and will need to more then likely have some agreement and documentation in place before any pricing changes are communicated or applied.

### Discounts

Our prices, as we have currently set them, are (intentionally) low relative to
our costs of providing the service. Although we price based on usage, 90% of our
costs do not relate to usage, but rather development of the product(s) and sales
and procurement support there-of. Thus discounting our usage-based pricing is
somewhat immaterial relative to the cost of providing the service, but does
affect our ability to build a sustainable business.

General Principles:

- In almost all cases, we would rather have a user on a discount than not have a
  user.
- Prefer alacrity over pricing accuracy in onboarding customers.
- Discounts are an exception rather than a rule. If most of our sales need
  discounts, we should adjust our pricing.
- Discounts should be time-limited to 6mo or less, 1y on exception. (For both
  accounting/MMR tracking and as a cause to re-visit.)
- Provide discounts to non-profit, or low-income-country users when prompted,
  even on our Pro plan.
- Use trials instead of discounts for business and enterprise users.
- Use pre-made Stripe coupons for discounts.
- Discounts should be limited in total spend (e.g. $100), beyond that it's a
  price adjustment or Trial.
- Business sales should not lead with discounts. Our Enterprise pricing already
  includes discounted rates within the pricing plan. Furthermore, more often
  we've found our prices are too-low for some established businesses (cause
  confusion during procurement). We can always negotiate around discounts
  deeper in the procurement process.
