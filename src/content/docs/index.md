Code Town Inc (d.b.a Shorebird) makes products that help businesses succeed with
Flutter. You can learn more about our products at
[https://shorebird.dev/](https://shorebird.dev/).

This handbook is a living document describing how we run the company. It's
public because we believe transparency builds trust with our team, our
customers, and the broader Flutter ecosystem.

## About

Code Town Inc was founded in January 2023 by leaders in the Flutter ecosystem
who saw a gap in how teams ship and operate mobile applications. Our flagship
product, **Code Push**, enables safe over-the-air updates for Flutter apps
allowing teams to fix bugs, ship features, and respond to issues without waiting
for app store approval.

We're a small, senior team that values developer velocity, reliability, and
craft. We build critical infrastructure that thousands of Flutter teams around
the world depend on every day.

## What's in this handbook

This handbook covers how we operate as a company. It's organized into three
sections:

**Company** — The fundamentals of working at Code Town Inc: company details,
onboarding, benefits, and more.

**Compliance** — Our security policies and compliance posture. We maintain these
policies as part of our commitment to enterprise-grade trust and accountability.

**Departments** — How our teams work detailed by department.

## How we work

We're a remote-first company with a lean structure that emphasizes high impact
over ceremony. A few principles guide how we operate:

- **Transparency by default.** This public handbook is one example. We
  communicate openly, document decisions, and share context broadly.
- **Developer velocity is our north star.** This applies to our products and to
  how we run the company. We move fast, ship often, and iterate based on real
  feedback.
- **Trust and accountability.** We hire experienced people, give them ownership,
  and trust them to deliver. In return, we hold ourselves to a high bar.
- **Customers come first.** We're building infrastructure that teams depend on.
  Reliability, responsiveness, and doing right by our customers drives every
  decision.

## Contributing

This handbook is maintained by the Code Town Inc team. If you notice something
that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or pull request as we do
appreciate the feedback. That said, changes are reviewed and approved by our
employees to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Our handbook is inspired by companies that have led the way in transparent,
public documentation, notably [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook) and
[PostHog](https://posthog.com/handbook). We're grateful for their example and
aim to achieve the same bar.
