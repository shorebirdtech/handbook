## Shorebird Discord

Shorebird uses Discord for (almost) all public & private communications.
https://discord.gg/shorebird

On the Shorebird Discord we group channels:

- Public (publicly read/writeable)
- Customers (private between use and individual customers)
- External (publicly readable, Shorebird writeable)
- Internal (Shorebird private)

We intentionally co-locate our private communications in the same app as our
public customers use. This makes it easy to chat with our customers directly
every day, and helps us make sure we're fixing things they care about.

There are trade-offs with this approach.

One tradeoff is it makes it easier to accidentally post something private in a
public space. One of the ways we try to avoid this is by defaulting to public.
With few exceptions, we try to do everything in the public, thus reducing risks
of things "accidentally" being public.

Another potential downside is that as we've grown the chatter and support
burden can be difficult. You should feel empowered to mute as much of Discord
as you need to do get your job done.
