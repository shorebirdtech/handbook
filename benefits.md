These guidelines will evolve over time. As written they are heavily influenced
by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

# Introduction
Benefits are currently written US-centric as all Shorebird employees currently
reside in the US.  We may adapt offered benefits in country/region specific
manners as we learn to employ persons there.

## Spending Company Money
Shorebird will pay for the items you need to get your job done.  We will provide
you equipment when you start and you will also be provided a company card
through which to order things needed to advance the company.  In general the
largest expense we have is YOU.  For a sense of scale: engineers in the US cost
~1k per workday, so if you're spending <1k to advance the company more than a
day forward, that's probably a win.

### Spending Guidelines

1. Spend company money like it is your own money. No, really. We hired you 
   because we believe you make good decisions. That includes with money.
3. You don't have to ask permission before making purchases in the interest of
   the company. When in doubt, do inform your manager prior to the purchase, or
   as soon as possible after the purchase.
3. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office
   supplies yourself and expense them. If you are unable to pay for any supplies
   yourself, please ask Eric to help.
4. You may privately use Shorebird property, a MacBook for example, to check
   your private e-mails or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law,
   harm Shorebird, or interfere with Intellectual Property.
5. If you make a purchase that will cost Shorebird $1000 USD per item (or over),
   this is classified as company property, you will be required to return the
   item(s) if you leave the company.

Any non-company expenses should not be paid with a company credit card.

## Paid Time Off

Shorebird has a flexible PTO policy up to 10 contiguous days without asking and
an expected minimum time-off of 10 days per calendar year.  We care about impact
on the company and our users, not your time at keyboard; stepping away from the
keyboard at times is an important part of ensuring our time working can be
productive.

Our time away is also balanced by the fact that we are a startup and always have
too many things to do with too few people (and only a finite amount of runway).
We all are here to move the company forward as quickly as possible when we
ourselves are healthy and able to do so.

## All Remote

Shorebird is an all-remote company.  We do not have an office.  We endeavor to
hire all over the globe (currently all employees are based in the US).  You're
welcome to work wherever you like (do let us know so we can send taxes to the
right place).

## Health Insurance

Shorebird offers competitive healthcare plans for all US employees and
dependents, including dental and vision. For 2023, we are covering 95% of 
premiums for employees and 50% of premiums for dependents. Our current
provider is Blue Cross Blue Shield, brokered through Rippling.com.

## 401k

Shorebird provides a 401k plan for all US employees with 4% employer match.
Our current provider is Guideline, brokered through Rippling.com.

## Parental Leave

Shorebird provisions for Parental Leave which may apply to team members but this
may vary depending on local country laws.  Currently this section is written
US-centric as all Shorebird employees currently reside in the US.

Shorebird provides 16 weeks of paid parental leave for any active team member
(regardless of gender) who becomes a parent through childbirth or adoption while
working at Shorebird.  The entire 16 week balance must be used within 12 months
of the birth or adoption.

As we've not yet had a team member take parental leave, so I'm sure there are
more details to cover when we get there.

## Life Insurance

We provide automatic 50k life insurance for all employees, with suplemental
insurance available through our provider, Beam.

## Short-term / Long-term Disability

We are unable to offer short or long term disability insurance at this time.
We've been told we must exist as a company for 2 years before we can offer
disability insurance. We'll update this section when we have more information.
