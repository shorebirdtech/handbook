Note: We've not had anyone join yet, so I'm sure it's incomplete so far.

Welcome to Shorebird!  We're *extremely* glad you're here.

This guide is here to walk you through your first (days).

If you have any problems, please email Eric!

# Days before
* You should get an email from Rippling after signing your offer letter.  This
will include instructions on how to set up your Rippling account and thus begin
the digital parts of the onboarding process.
* A laptop should have been delivered to your home address already.

Our customers are primarily on Windows and targeting Android devices.  You
should have access to a Windows device, even if it's not your primary device.
Best if it's your primary device, but it's most important that you feel
productive on whatever you're using.

# Day you join

## Accounts

* Rippling should have offered you a chance to pick your GSuite username as part
  of your offer paperwork.  That account should be enabled before you start on
  your first day, you should get an email to your personal account.
* You will use your existing GitHub account, but you will be added to the
  Shorebird organization.  This is currently manual (we've not set up Rippling to do it):
  https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/people
* You will use your existing Discord account, but you will be added to the
  "Birder" role on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/9hKJcWGcaB). 
  We could automate this with a Discord [Linked Role](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10388356626711)
  but haven't yet.
  `Server Settings > Roles > Birder > Add Member`
  

# Communication

* As per above, you will be added to the "Birder" role and you will
  have admin powers on the Discord.  As a Birder, you'll see our (few) private
  company channels and customer channels as well as the public ones.
* You should consider muting Discord, except for @mentions.  If Discord ends up
  too noisy, we'll find something quieter for internal communication.
* You have an email address, but don't expect to use it a ton.  We're too little
  to need to email each other much.
* You have a calendar, but also don't plan to use it a ton.  Eric has meetings
  with the outside world, but the rest of the company shouldn't need to meet
  much yet.

# Forms
* There are a few tax forms required to fill out on your first day.  In the US
  that's W-4 and W-9.  Rippling will help you take care of this.
* If you have an iPhone you can use the "Notes" app to scan the signed documents
  as pdfs.  Android likely has something similar.

# Finances
* Paychecks are delivered every 2 weeks.  Rippling should have offered you direct
  deposits.  Let Eric know if you have any trouble getting set up.

# Code

* Once you've been added to the Shorebird organization on GitHub, you should
  clone the internal `_shorebird` repo.  It will automatically clone the
  public repo `shorebird` for you as a submodule.

# Product
* Please try the product (if you haven't already).  We are here to build
  something people want.  What have you seen customers need in trying to use
  Flutter/Dart?  We should build that.  We keep a list of customer pain in the
  Handbook, please feel free to add to it.

# Please edit the handbook
* I'm sure there is a ton missing from this onboarding guide and the handbook
  more generally.  Please send at least one PR to the handbook.  I'm sure you
  learned things through onboarding the next person should know.
